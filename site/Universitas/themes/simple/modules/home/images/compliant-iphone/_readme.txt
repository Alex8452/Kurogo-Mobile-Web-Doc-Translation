Place high-density module icons here to support Retina Display iPhones and iPod Touches. These PNGs can be up to twice the width and height specified for the springboard module-icon images in your theme CSS. For instance, if the springboard img size is set in CSS as 60x60px, the PNGs in this folder can be up to 120x120px (larger images will work but will be larger files without any visible benefit). In practice, anything beyond ~1.5x resolution (90x90px) yields significantly larger file size with diminishing marginal benefits in terms of visible quality.
