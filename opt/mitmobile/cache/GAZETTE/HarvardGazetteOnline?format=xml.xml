		<description><![CDATA[Former Crimson basketball co-captain Jeremy Lin '10 has been signed as a point guard to the Golden State Warriors.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Harvard guard and three-time All-Ivy League honoree <a href="http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/mbkb/2009-10/bios/Jeremy_Lin_Bio">Jeremy Lin</a> ’10 has signed a multiple-year professional contract with the <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/index_main.html">Golden State Warriors</a> of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). Lin is attempting to become the first Asian-American player to play in the NBA since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Walters">Rex Walters</a> was a member of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/heat/">Miami Heat</a> in 2000.</p>
<p>Lin is also in line to be the first Ivy League player to play for an NBA team since <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania’s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Maloney">Matt Maloney</a> suited up for the <a href="http://www.nba.com/hawks/">Atlanta Hawks</a> and <a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale University’s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dudley">Chris Dudley</a> was a member of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/blazers/">Portland Trail Blazers</a> in 2003. In his first game with the Warriors, Lin will join former Harvard standouts Saul Mariaschin ’47 (<a href="http://www.nba.com/celtics/">Boston Celtics</a>) and Edward Smith ’51 (<a href="http://www.nba.com/knicks/">New York Knicks</a>) as Crimson players who have seen time in the NBA.</p>
<p>A native of Palo Alto, Calif., who guided Palo Alto High School to a state championship, Lin will now join his hometown professional franchise. Lin recently averaged 9.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.2 steals per game while playing with the <a href="http://www.nba.com/mavericks/">Dallas Mavericks</a> Summer League team earlier this month. He scored 13 points against the <a href="http://www.nba.com/wizards">Washington Wizards</a> on July 15 and enjoyed a pair of 12-point efforts against the <a href="http://www.nba.com/nuggets/">Denver Nuggets</a> on July 9 and the <a href="http://www.nba.com/kings/">Sacramento Kings</a> on July 18.  Lin, who stands at 6’3”, also shot 54.5 percent from the floor and 66.7 percent from behind the arc while averaging 18.6 minutes in those five games.</p>
<p>As a senior in 2009-10, Lin, 21, was a finalist for the <a href="http://www.cousyaward.com/">Bob Cousy Award</a>, which goes to the nation’s top point guard as well as the <a href="http://www.woodenaward.com/">John R. Wooden Award</a> for the national player of the year. A four-time Ivy League Player of the Week honoree this past season, Lin led the Crimson in scoring as a senior with 16.4 points per game. He also paced Harvard with 4.6 assists per contest and topped the Ancient Eight with 71 steals, marking the third straight year he finished first in the Ivy League in steals. Harvard also enjoyed the program&#8217;s winningest season in 2009-10, as the team recorded 21 victories and qualified for the postseason for the first time since 1946.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.sportswriters.net/usbwa/index.html">U.S. Basketball Writers Association</a> and <a href="http://www.nabc.org/">National Association of Basketball Coaches</a> all-district team honoree, as well as a Lou Henson All-America selection, Lin completed his Harvard career as the only player in Ivy League history to record 1,450 points (1,482), 450 rebounds (494), 400 assists (406), and 200 steals (225). Lin helped rewrite the Harvard record books, as he finished his career first in all-time games played (115) and was second in steals and fifth in points and assists.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Harvard experts weigh in on a massive finance reform bill that draws praise, skepticism — and ire. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year in the making, the sweeping new financial reform bill was finally signed into law today (July 21).</p>
<p>But is the <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/financialsvcs_dem/prfinal_062610.shtml">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> a boon, a bust — or just a bore?</p>
<p>Some critics say the bill goes too far — that it will drive banking business overseas and stifle financial innovation.</p>
<p>Others say the bill (dubbed “Dud-Frank”) does not go far enough, that the bill opens regulatory loopholes for — among others — community banks, auto dealers, and commercial banks that want to make risky investments.</p>
<p>The controversy may be a function of scale. Dodd-Frank weighs in at around 2,300 pages, and proposes sweeping arcs of reform: a new agency to protect consumers, new government powers to dismantle failing banks, and new layers of oversight and regulation.</p>
<p>“If the goal of the bill is to prevent another crisis or substantially blunt its effects then it is a disappointment,” said <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=438648">Clayton S. Rose</a>, a professor of management practice at <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/">Harvard Business School</a> (HBS) and a onetime global investment and equities executive with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Parts of the bill address finance reform in meaningful ways, he said — like significantly enhancing transparency in the derivative markets. But the bill neglects two issues “at the center of the crisis,” said Rose: the idea that some firms are “too big to fail” and short-term funding by financial firms.</p>
<p>These deficits in the bill, he said, will increase — not reduce — risk to the U.S. financial sector. “There was too much focus on proprietary trading and hedge funds, which had limited involvement in the crisis,” said Rose — a misplaced focus that he called “political theater.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, “the same regulatory agencies and individuals responsible for oversight going into the crisis are responsible now,” said Rose.</p>
<p>“There are lots of good things in the financial reform bill,” countered economist <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/jeffrey-frankel">Jeffrey A. Frankel</a>, who is the James W. Harpel Professor of Capital Formation and Growth at the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School</a>. He called the legislation “a major breakthrough.”</p>
<p>But there were also disappointments, said Frankel, who served on the Clinton-era <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/">Council of Economic Advisers</a> from 1996 to 1999. For one, the bill lacks a tax on banks, coordinated with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank would also have been better “if some Republicans had joined in to try to make the bill better, instead of fighting every step of the way,” he said.</p>
<p>Then there was the sting of compromise, said Frankel. “Some good aspects had to be watered down to win passage, just like the 2009 fiscal stimulus and the health insurance bill.”</p>
<p>Other parts of Dodd-Frank are worse than disappointing, he said. “That the auto dealers are exempt from the consumer protection agency is an astounding travesty. It shows that big banks aren’t the only ones with lobbying clout.”</p>
<p>Historian and economist <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=dmoss">David A. Moss</a>, the John G. McLean Professor of Business Administration at HBS, had a basically hopeful view of the Dodd-Frank bill, too, though it was tinged with caution.</p>
<p>“The financial reform bill represents a major step forward,” he said, but nothing is perfect. “Like virtually every product of American democracy, it is a creature of compromise, and therefore will fully satisfy no one, including me.”</p>
<p>Still, Dodd-Frank “authorizes regulators to tighten regulatory standards for the biggest and most systematically dangerous financial institutions,” said Moss, “and to liquidate these institutions in an orderly way if they get into serious trouble.”</p>
<p>If tighter standards had been in place a decade ago, or in the 1990s, he said, “we might have avoided the worst aspects of the recent financial crisis.”</p>
<p>One question remains, said Moss: How will regulators use their new authority? Will they be tough and tighten standards, but then loosen standards as the crisis fades?</p>
<p>“Continued vigilance — both now and over the long term — is absolutely essential to prevent another crisis,” he said. “The financial reform legislation gives regulators the necessary tools, but it will be up to the regulators themselves to use them.”</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank leaves defining the rules up to the regulators, “for hundreds and hundreds of issues,” said Rose. “It will be literally years before we actually understand how the new law will be put into practice.”</p>
<p>Does Dodd-Frank represent what a better financial system would look like?</p>
<p>That question was the subject of a monthlong online debate sponsored by the <a href="http://hbr.org/magazine">Harvard Business Review</a>. Throughout June, “Finance: The Way Forward” drew <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/finance-the-way-forward/">commentary</a> from 19 scholars, executives, writers, and investors.</p>
<p>Among the list of high-level bloggers was <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=220890">Robert C. Pozen</a>, senior lecturer of business administration at Harvard Business School. He is also chairman of a company (MFS Investment Management) that manages more than $200 billion in assets for 5 million investors worldwide.</p>
<p>“The bill takes several steps in the right direction,” said Pozen. It sets up a council for systemic risk, for one, and a clearing corporation that will track derivatives and register hedge fund managers.</p>
<p>But the bill also “reaches some confusing compromises in areas like the Volker Rule and consumer protection,” he said. (The Volcker Rule, endorsed by the White House in January, would prevent commercial banks from engaging in risky trading.)</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank also fails to address certain big problems, said Pozen, including <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=220890">Fannie Mae</a>. (That’s the Federal National Mortgage Association, which was implicated in the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007.)</p>
<p>Of all the reform bill’s provisions, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remains one of the most visible. It would oversee small-scale transactions involving ATM fees, checking accounts, credit cards, and mortgages.</p>
<p>The bureau was the brainchild of <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=82">Elizabeth Warren</a>, the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Law School</a>. She is on leave while she directs the <a href="http://cop.senate.gov/">Congressional Oversight Panel</a> on bank bailout funds.</p>
<p>Warren is one of several Massachusetts connections to the reform bill. For one, it is named after <a href="http://www.house.gov/frank/">Barney Frank</a>, the Newton, Mass., Democrat who chairs the <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a>. (It is also named after Sen. <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Christopher Dodd</a>, a Connecticut Democrat.)</p>
<p>Another Massachusetts connection: Only three Republican senators voted for Dodd-Frank. One of them was Sen. <a href="http://scottbrown.senate.gov/public/">Scott Brown</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Harvard Medical School released a series of revisions to its conflict of interest policy that strengthens its commitment to transparency and financial disclosure while recognizing the School’s commitment to industry collaboration.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS) released a series of revisions to its conflict of interest  (COI) policy today (July 21) that strengthens its commitment to transparency and financial disclosure while recognizing the School’s commitment to industry collaboration.</p>
<p>Among many provisions, the new policy includes a streamlined central system for reporting faculty financial interests with industry; requires the public disclosure of certain faculty financial interests; bans faculty from accepting corporate gifts, including travel and meals; and ends faculty participation in industry speakers bureaus, making it one of the most stringent of any medical college in the country. In addition, faculty disclosures will be made available to the public on the <a href="http://catalyst.harvard.edu/home.html">Harvard Catalyst </a>website.</p>
<p>“In all cases where financial interests are involved, an essential antidote to potential harm is transparency,” said HMS Dean <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/public/news/bio.html">Jeffrey S. Flier</a>. &#8220;And so disclosure of relevant financial interests, both internally and for the first time publicly, will address this concern.”</p>
<p>Flier, the Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine, said the updated policy is aimed at clarifying appropriate relationships between the School and its industry contacts. It will protect the interests of the public and maintain the integrity of Harvard’s faculty and institutions, he said, while providing clarity of expectations in collaboration between companies and Harvard faculty.</p>
<p>A comprehensive re-evaluation of the existing COI regulations has been a top priority for Flier since he was named dean in 2007, and the revised guidelines are the latest in a series of regular changes to a policy created in 1990.</p>
<p>In January 2009, Flier convened the <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/public/coi/policy/integritypolicy.html">Harvard University Faculty of Medicine Committee on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment</a>. The 34-member panel includes HMS faculty, senior administrators, and students. His request to the group: Devise a new set of recommendations for the faculty policy, based on changes in the biomedical field and grounded in modern conventions and practices.</p>
<p>Ganesh Shankar — a medical student member of the committee — thought the new standards were an exciting reshaping of the &#8220;educational infrastructure&#8221; at HMS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medicine is constantly changing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we recognize that education in medicine must be equally dynamic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee’s recommendations, accepted by Flier, will be formally incorporated into the School&#8217;s COI policy starting in January.</p>
<p>The HMS group is a subcommittee of a University-wide body led by David Korn, Harvard’s vice provost for research, which recently conducted its own rigorous review of Harvard&#8217;s COI policies and principles.</p>
<p>Previous HMS policy had regulated faculty interactions with industry for more than 20 years. The new guidelines include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a streamlined central system for reporting faculty financial interests with industry</li>
<li>a public website for disclosure of certain faculty financial interests</li>
<li>no personal gifts from industry, including travel and meals</li>
<li>no faculty participation in industry speakers bureaus</li>
<li>a further strengthening of existing limitations on faculty financial interests in companies that own or license technologies studied in clinical research</li>
<li>new limitations on industry support for <a href="http://cme.hms.harvard.edu/">Continuing Medical Education</a> (CME) courses</li>
<li>new training for students and faculty on critical decision making regarding companies that make drugs or medical devices</li>
<li>new review requirements on proposed faculty board memberships with for-profit companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flier, a strong proponent of industry collaboration, has acknowledged that relationships between industry and academics involve an element of risk. &#8220;Some relationships,&#8221; he wrote in a white paper last year, &#8220;require scrutiny, analysis, institutional guidance, and, in specific cases, prohibition.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, even as he announced the new, more stringent guidelines, Flier wanted to make absolutely clear that the goal was not to create a wall between industry and medicine. “That would be precisely the wrong thing to do at a time when we want to promote and develop human health,” he said. “Doing that requires effective interactions between industry and academia of a kind that are judged to be appropriate.”</p>
<p>The central theme of the revised policy is transparency and increased disclosure of industry relationships, especially as related to ongoing research. They reinforce the restrictions already in place by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibiting sponsorship of any research project by a business in which a faculty members holds equity. The prohibition is absolute if the business is privately held. If the business is publicly traded, then a faculty member’s financial interest in the company cannot exceed $30,000 a year.</li>
<li>Prohibiting clinical research on a technology owned or licensed to a business with which the faculty member receives more that $10,000 in annual income. (The previous limit was $20,000.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting of outside relationships with industry, including those relevant to ongoing faculty research, will continue to be part of a yearly disclosure process. And for the first time, Harvard will work with its 16 affiliated hospitals and institutions to capture all required information through a common reporting mechanism for the approximately 12,000 Harvard Medical School employees who work at the Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and institutions. Previously, each organization managed its own disclosure process.</p>
<p>Also for the first time, such financial disclosures will also be made publicly available on the HMS Catalyst website and will be part of a comprehensive institutional monitoring system. In certain instances, financial disclosures will also be subject to review by the HMS Standing Committee on Conflict of Interest.</p>
<p>The new disclosure mechanism, Flier said, will allow HMS to identify any potentially troubling trends and “areas where there might be a need for further policy revision.”</p>
<p>The new recommendations will also prohibit faculty participation in industry speakers bureaus if only industry presentations are used.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the biggest departures in the policy,” said Flier. “If you are Harvard Medical faculty, you can’t function as a member of a speakers bureau and give company-determined and prepared talks. It’s vital that our faculty maintain their intellectual control.”</p>
<p>The new guidelines also impact the small percentage of <a href="http://cme.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard’s Continuing Medical Education</a> courses that receive company funding.</p>
<p>Building on previous requirements, the new recommendations state that a course must be funded by more than one industry sponsor, with no one sponsor being able to support more than 50 percent of a particular course’s budget.</p>
<p>As part of the new policy, HMS will also develop a dean’s fund. It will solicit unrestricted industry donations to support Harvard’s Continuing Medical Education efforts, including research on best CME practices and technology-based teaching methods. “There will be no connection between the company and what we do with it,” said Flier.</p>
<p>He added that the fund “ties into the broader interest of how to use Harvard Medical School to have a positive influence in the world.”</p>
<p>Included in the new policy is a broad statement, in compliance with Massachusetts law, that prohibits the faculty from receiving industry-sponsored personal gifts of any kind. The new HMS gifts requirement will also extend to nonclinical faculty.</p>
<p>“Even if you are a Ph.D. scientist working on cells or mice you are subject to this policy,” said Flier. “We are now saying that this is part of our overall faculty policy.”</p>
<p>The updated HMS COI policy, said Korn, who heads the University’s efforts on COI policy, will further the School’s dedication to professional codes, institutional values, integrity, and transparency. It will also help HMS continue its efforts to enhance the future health of the country. “When all parties are clear on the rules governing potential relationships, and compliant with them, the hope is that more collaborations may be fostered and the significant educational, research, and health benefits captured for the benefit of the public.”</p>
<p>“Under our new policy, we will limit potential abuses,&#8221; wrote Flier in an article appearing on the HMS website, &#8220;while promoting our great capacity to do good.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Harvard Corporation has adopted a University-wide conflict of interest policy, the first time such a policy has been crafted to cover faculty members across the entire campus.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The<a href="http://www.harvard.edu/administration/corporation.php"> Harvard Corporation</a> has adopted a University-wide conflict of interest policy, the first time such a policy has been crafted to cover faculty members across the entire campus. Drafted by a faculty committee chaired by Vice Provost David Korn, it is intended to serve as a framework within which each of the Schools will tailor rules to the specific circumstances of their faculties. It is expected that every School will produce a set of policies that is at least as stringent as those in the guidelines set out in the University policy, and that some will be even more stringent. The Gazette sat down with Provost <a href="http://www.provost.harvard.edu/people/">Steven E. Hyman</a> and Vice Provost Korn to discuss the way the new University-wide policy was developed, and the impact it is expected to have.</p>
<p><strong>Gazette: </strong><br />
Why was it necessary, at this specific moment in time, to draft a University-wide conflict of interest policy?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hyman: </strong><br />
Harvard is increasingly committed to research that might lead to products that will improve the lot of humankind. In our society, products make it out of the lab and into the world — where they can create benefit — through a process of commercialization. So some Harvard faculty are being encouraged to commercialize their research or otherwise engage with the private sector, in addition to writing papers for publication in notable journals.</p>
<p>At the same time we are encouraging this kind of collaboration with private industry, it’s also important that we address our rules governing financial conflicts of interest. It’s very important to note that we’re living in a period of history when the news media, the general public, and members of Congress and government agencies are very concerned that potential financial conflicts might interfere with the kind of objective exploration and reporting of science that is at the very heart of the academic enterprise.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Korn: </strong><br />
The University is not designed to be an ivory tower isolated from the world. So the trick is to be able to have a robust system for affording faculty opportunities to engage with the commercial world and at the same time not threaten in any way their own fundamental integrity or that of Harvard.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gazette: </strong><br />
But these guidelines apply to far more than just work in the sciences, don’t they? Aren’t they meant to guide the formation of policies at Schools as diverse as the <a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/">Divinity School</a>, the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/">School of Education</a>, the <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>, and <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Hyman:</strong><br />
They are. And it’s very important to realize that while most commercialization used to occur only in a small number of departments and a minority of Schools, increasingly we see more and more collaboration across departmental and School boundaries. For example, we see connections between engineering and chemistry in FAS [<a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/">Faculty of Arts and Sciences</a>] and the Medical School, or between diverse parts of the University and the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/">School of Public Health</a>, where again faculty may be engaged in private sector collaborations or commercialization. Policymakers outside the University and our own governing bodies — that is the Harvard Corporation and the <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/05/haa-announces-2010-board-of-overseers-election-results/">Board of Overseers</a> — encouraged us to develop a set of policies that could apply to the whole University, rather than creating artificial boundaries with nothing but separate policies. And then David and the committee came up with the really inspired idea that while we should be governed by a shared set of principles, given the different cultures of the diverse faculties at our University, with different kinds of engagement with the private sector, implementation should be a matter that is School-specific, with the proviso that School basic implementations can’t deviate from the spirit or the letter of the University policy.</p>
<p><strong>Korn:</strong><br />
The frontiers of much scholarship, especially in the sciences — basic and applied, behavioral and natural — are increasingly multidisciplinary because the problems now on the table are so large and complicated; teams of individuals from multiple disciplines have to come together with their various resources to make these huge projects tractable. And it simply isn’t feasible to have a team in any walk of life, whether it’s research or whether it’s basketball or football, where the team members play under different rules and behavioral expectations. It just doesn’t work. It’s certainly true that many of the Schools in the University had in their own faculty policy publications some mention of conflicts of interest. But in many instances they were neither concordant nor robust, so building a policy that would enable the Schools to become more harmonized in the ways they deal with these matters was a driving goal of the committee that we formed to wrestle with this issue.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gazette:</strong><br />
So we now have an overarching University-wide policy that sets the parameters for the development of individual School policies. And the Medical School has completed a revision of its existing policy, creating conflict of interest standards that in many areas exceed the University guidelines. What about the other Schools — is there a set time by which they must create policies?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hyman:</strong><br />
We haven’t set a time limit yet.  In the early fall, David and I will sit down and take the necessary steps toward creating School-based implementations of the policy. I think it’s critical that David and his colleagues [on what will be a standing committee on conflict of interest] provide technical assistance, because for some of the Schools, this is a very new set of ideas. For Schools that are already engaged in science, engineering, and quantitative social science, these are not new issues. We’ve already begun a series of discussions with the deans of Arts and Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, and Public Health about School-based implementations. And those deans, well aware of the extraordinary degree of collaboration that occurs among the faculty their Schools, have pledged themselves to creating implementations that are as like to each other as possible, and in particular, having identical implementations with respect to human subjects research or clinical research, so that faculty don’t face what might be called bureaucratic double jeopardy when they engage in collaborative projects.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Korn: </strong><br />
It’s important to realize that the cultures and practices and historic interactions within the Harvard community vary enormously across the Schools. For example, the Business School exists to create leadership in the business community. And to do that requires the inculcation of values and skills necessary to achieve that objective, requires that there be much more interaction between students and faculty with business entities, than say might be necessary or considered normal in a philosophy department, or an arts department. Similar interactions are often necessary in the School of Education, and in the Design School. And yet the ways in which these different disciplines and professions practice these interactions also vary, as does the culture of what is considered appropriate and what isn’t. And none of that means that one is right and one is wrong. It’s just that the rules of a medical school would be entirely inappropriate in many respects for a law school or school of education. That’s why flexibility in how the policy is implemented is incredibly important in a University with such diverse areas of scholarship and professional education. It’s virtually impossible to get a one-size-fits-all policy that isn’t strained and artificial and unnecessarily burdensome.</p>
<p><strong>Gazette:</strong><br />
Dr. Korn, as a graduate of the College and Harvard Medical School, you were familiar with much that is unique about Harvard. But you’d been away for decades, at Stanford, where you were chair of the Department of Pathology, and then dean of the School of Medicine, and then at the Association of American Medical Colleges, where you were a vice president. Given that time away, what surprised you the most when you returned here to take on this task?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Korn:</strong><br />
The unique feature, which I knew about but hadn’t thought about for a very, very long time, is the remarkable decentralization of the University. That in a lot of ways creates an interesting challenge for any form of central guidance or leadership, no matter what it is. The Schools have historically been very independent, and they have thrived in their independence. And the idea of coming together to develop University-wide policies is not common. So when Steve and I put the committee together to take on this task, we agreed we’d have representation from every School. We weighted the committee a bit with three members from FAS, acknowledging the three divisions, and three members from the Medical School — including hospital-based professors who are highly regarded as leaders of the academic medical community. Every other School had a single member. When the committee met initially I asked each member to introduce him or herself, and asked that they speak about conflict of interest matters that they were aware of in their own areas that bothered them. That led to an incredible amount of enthusiastic participation. The second thing we did was to get the members to define the goals, missions, and values of Harvard University. That wasn’t part of our charge, but I decided to ask the committee members to articulate what they thought were the missions and values of the University. The reason that was important was that from that point forward, the entire discussion of financial conflicts of interest and how to manage them was driven by the shared agreement, that these missions and values were core and had to be protected from any sort of undermining or tarnishing. And it was that shared agreement on what it is we’re trying to protect that really drove the process, I thought, very, very nicely to the endpoint late last fall. Everybody joined in the melee: They all contributed and they all signed off in the end. I thought the process worked extraordinarily well.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gazette:</strong><br />
Is this the first time in Harvard history that there’s been such a collaborative project by representatives of all the Schools?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hyman:</strong><br />
I can’t speak to Harvard history, but certainly in my time here we’ve never had a process that involved so many iterations among all of the deans, a committee representing faculty from the entire University, our governing bodies. And what’s remarkable, and here I refer back to something that David said, which is very important for many parts of the University: This was very new, but everybody understood it was very consequential and very important that we get it right, that we not stifle innovation and connection to the private sector, but that we create a set of policies that were clear and that would make sure that our values didn’t become transgressed in those interactions. So clearly, he had a stiff challenge.</p>
<p>There were times hearing David’s reports and in talking to the deans when I was worried that there was too large a gulf between the Schools that support science and engineering and the rest of the University. And I was quite pleased to see everybody come together so quickly and produce such an effective document. Of course, the work isn’t done yet. We still need these implementations. But I have a lot of confidence that we’ll get there, partly because David and his colleagues on what will be a standing successor committee are committed to making this work.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gazette:</strong><br />
So, the next step is forming a new standing committee on financial conflicts of interest, which will aid the Schools in the development of their policies and will ultimately have to approve those policies. Then what?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Korn: </strong><br />
The University Standing Committee on Financial Conflicts of Interest will be the formal instrument for overseeing the implementation plans of the various Schools. It will be available for consultation with the Schools. It will have to approve the implementation plans of each School. And it will be the body that will receive the audit reports that the policy also calls for. <a href="http://vpf-web.harvard.edu/rmas/">Harvard’s Risk Management and Audit Services</a> is to audit each School at least once every three years to obtain insight and evidence of how well the Schools are employing the policy. And the audit reports will be given to me and shared with the committee so that the committee gains insight into how the Schools are complying, or where there may be problems that need some help, or where some aspect of the policy may simply not be working out as well as it sounded in concept, in which case we might propose some modifications to the President and Provost.</p>
<p>Faculty members in each School will file both annual and transactional reports. Transactional reports will be filed for specific things, such as gifts or contracts or such, in which the faculty member or their immediate family has what the School regards as a significant financial relationship with the donor or sponsor that might be seen as creating a conflict of interest. The Schools are given a fair amount of discretion in how they’re going to implement this requirement, and among those discretions will be deciding what kinds and magnitudes of financial relationships their faculty might have that the Schools need to know about.</p>
<p><strong>Hyman:</strong><br />
One really important thing that David is touching on is that the policy will call for disclosure of relevant potential conflicts of interest to the dean of a School. This does not imply that these disclosures will be made public, and I think that’s something that has been misunderstood. Now in medicine, there are both federal laws affecting drug companies and state laws that will lead to some disclosures being made public. It is important to note that it has become part of our culture to expect that if a physician wants to consult with a pharmaceutical company, that consultation will become a matter of public record with the view, shared by many, that some patients will want to know whether their doctor is engaged with or getting compensation from a pharmaceutical or medical device company. But as a matter of University policy, a Law School faculty member, for example, or a Design School faculty member making a disclosure to the dean will not have these disclosures made available to the public.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gazette:</strong><br />
Isn’t this process of internal review much like the Institutional Review Board process for research involving human subjects, a process in which there is a careful, detailed review, but that review is confidential?<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Korn:</strong><br />
I think, in a way, that’s a fair analogy. The process won’t be identical, but it will require a similarly careful, fact-driven balancing of risks and benefits, and then making decisions about whether and how to allow the research to go forward — or not.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Harvard University Policy on Individual Financial Conflicts of Interest for Persons Holding Faculty and Teaching Appointments (University Conflict of Interest Policy) is built upon 12 principles that establish a framework to guide the Schools in developing their implementation plans. The Schools’ implementation of the policy will be audited on a regular basis by the University’s Risk Management and Audit Services, and the audit reports will be reviewed by the vice provost for research and a new standing University Committee on Financial Conflicts of Interest.</p>
<p>Among other elements, the Schools’ plans must:</p>
<p>• Ensure that faculty members’ educational and research activities are motivated by a commitment to the advancement of knowledge and not compromised by their outside activities and financial relationships. A faculty member should avoid circumstances that reasonable observers would believe create an undue risk that the prospect of direct or indirect personal financial gain could inappropriately influence the faculty member’s judgment or actions in fulfilling his or her University duties.</p>
<p>• Include a robust system of annual reporting by faculty members of their and their immediate family members’ outside financial interests that may be related to their academic responsibilities. Additionally, the plans must include provisions for the reporting of new potential conflicts when they first arise.</p>
<p>• Require that written records be maintained by the School of the processes by which reported financial interests are reviewed and evaluated for the possibility of creating financial conflicts of interest that raise concern, and how such conflicts will be eliminated, reduced, or managed, as well as disclosed, to minimize the risk of undue bias of the faculty member’s research and scholarship, teaching, mentoring, and public service.</p>
<p>• Ensure that faculty members’ outside financial interests not adversely influence their instruction, guidance, or supervision of students (including trainees and postdoctoral fellows). Academic assignments to students should principally serve their interests in learning, self-development, and satisfaction of requirements for academic advancement.</p>
<p>• Provide for sanctions for failures to comply with the rules, reporting requirements, and other policy provisions.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A social scientist looks at how a patient China is reversing brain drain to the West. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese have an expression for what you get by studying overseas: <em>du jing</em>, or “a glaze of gold.”</p>
<p>“You paint a gold layer on yourself,” said Hong Kong University social scientist David Zweig, who lectured at Harvard this week (July 19). Returning home to China, he said, means you have a leg up on a good job and fast promotions.</p>
<p>Zweig, a onetime fellow at Harvard’s <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~fairbank/">Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies</a>, was in Cambridge to offer a glimpse of his book-in-progress on China’s gold-layered returnees.</p>
<p>Why do they come back, and what role does the Chinese government play in getting them back?</p>
<p>The short answers: They come back to make money, but not to change China’s politics.</p>
<p>And the government is doing more than ever to get returnees back — but they would come back on their own anyway.</p>
<p>The real answers are more complicated, and involve the complex interactions of many people, said Zweig: government officials, students, scholars, entrepreneurs, and families.</p>
<p>Returnees bring ideas and energy back to China, but they bring home problems too, he said. For one, Chinese who earned less prestigious domestic degrees are resentful of the preferential treatment returnees get.</p>
<p>But the earliest problem with returnees was that there were so few. In the two decades after 1978, barely a third of Chinese students who went overseas came back. Among students who paid their own way, the rate of return was 3 percent, said Zweig.</p>
<p>This weak return rate weakened even more after 1989, when the Tiananmen Square incident scared off more returnees — and even triggered a government search for “class enemies” among students abroad.</p>
<p>But by the mid-1990s, attitudes had changed and patient China took the long view. Most of its leadership came to see brain drain as a means of “storing brainpower overseas,” said Zweig. Today, they see it as “brain circulation,” he said — an investment that will eventually pay China back.</p>
<p>The signs of payback are there already. Since 2000, the number of returnees has boomed upward. Political change is not the reason, he said, since there has not been much. Instead, Chinese come back because they see liberalized capital markets and an acceptance of private property.</p>
<p>In short, said Zweig, returnees “can make a buck.”</p>
<p>Since 1978, about 1.3 million Chinese students and scholars have gone abroad to study — most of them to Japan, the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p>The earliest going overseas were hardcore elements dedicated to the Communist ideal. “They never thought about not going back,” said Zweig.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese go abroad with a strategy in mind: Search for what is in short supply at home, then bring it back.</p>
<p>Returnees are called <em>hai gui</em>, or “sea turtles,” said Zweig, named after the creatures who are born on shore, travel at sea, then instinctively return home.</p>
<p>Other returnees — <em>hai ou</em> — increasingly keep ties to the West, and even maintain businesses and residences there. They are “seagulls,” he said, who fly back and forth over the sea.</p>
<p>Returnees may be glazed in gold, but coming back to China has its bumps, said Zweig. For one, many Chinese come home with expectation of getting jobs immediately. When they don’t, they form a demographic clog that earned another sea analogy: <em>hai dai</em>, or “seaweed.”</p>
<p>Returnees are diverse, said Zweig. Beginning in 1991, he has interviewed or studied academics, scientific researchers, entrepreneurs, master’s degree (and M.B.A.) students, undergraduates, executives, professionals, and government officials.</p>
<p>Academics go abroad to get “good platforms” for advancement upon their return, said Zweig, but then they often refuse to write for domestic academic journals.</p>
<p>Some scientists return, attracted by China’s “Hundred Talents” program and other incentives, but then they burden systems already top-heavy with full professors, he added.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are attracted to the idea that even ordinary Western technology can lead to profit in China. And they like the idea of China’s high-tech, low-tax enterprise zones. (Zweig called them “one-stop chopping” zones — that is, places where paperwork — “chop” — is reduced.)</p>
<p>Then again, entrepreneurs are also disappointed at the lack of start-up capital in China, and their homeland’s weak protections for intellectual property.</p>
<p>Some master’s degree students abroad come home and are jobless “seaweed” for up to a year, said Zweig. But worse, they may be the victims of diploma mills and third-rate universities — especially in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Master’s students may also come home with few economic advantages. They will make $200 a month more than those who stayed in China, he said, but their families take on $20,000 or more in debt for one year of overseas study.</p>
<p>There are other burdens on families, who may only rarely see their children again, said Helen Ji Li, a China-born independent researcher. Many of the students are only children like herself, she said. “It is kind of sad. Once you’ve left, the parents have no other children in China.”</p>
<p>Zweig acknowledged the great financial sacrifice families make. But in households with more than one child, he said, study abroad is also “a diversification of risk and opportunity.”</p>
<p>One fact emerging from the data, said Zweig, is that returnees always argue for more openness in China, but they remain indifferent about political action.</p>
<p>Still, he said, their influence will be felt politically one day.</p>
<p>After all, the biggest benefit of returnees may be the worldliness and cultural diversity they bring, said Zweig. “They’re greatly increasing China’s international flavor.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[New paper answers the long-standing scientific question about cause of tropics’ stunning biodiversity.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tropics owe their stunning biodiversity to consistent year-round temperatures, not higher temperatures or more sunlight, according to a novel survey of insect diversity at different latitudes and at different points in the planet’s history.</p>
<p>The finding, presented this week (July 20) in the journal <a href="http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/">Paleobiology</a> by researchers from <a href="http://harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>, <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>, and <a href="http://www.brandonu.ca/home/">Brandon University</a>, may finally answer a question that has dogged scientists for centuries.</p>
<p>It also suggests, intriguingly, that the world is likely far less diverse today than it was tens of millions of years ago, when the entire Earth had consistent year-round temperatures, much like the modern tropics.</p>
<p>“The latitudinal diversity gradient has been recognized for 150 years as one of the most general observations in nature, and has produced more explanatory hypotheses than nearly any other observation,” says co-author <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/farrell/farrell-oeb.html">Brian D. Farrell</a>, professor of biology at Harvard. “We show that when most of today’s organisms were diversifying, up through the Eocene [epoch], the world lacked pronounced seasonality, more like today’s tropics, even in areas where the temperature was low.”</p>
<p>“It appears it’s not the heat of the tropics that promotes diversity; it’s the newer seasons of the temperate zone that depress diversity.”</p>
<p>Scientists’ explanations for tropical biodiversity have tended to focus on the greater heat and light found closer to the equator, and to a lesser extent on the low seasonality of the tropics, where average temperature in the hottest and coolest months may vary by only a few degrees.</p>
<p>“These factors tend to change together as you travel away from the equator to-ward the poles, leaving it difficult to separate their individual effects on diversity,” says  lead author <a href="http://www.brucearchibald.com/">S. Bruce Archibald</a>, a research associate at Simon Fraser University, Harvard’s <a href="http://www.mcz.harvard.edu/">Museum of Comparative Zoology</a>, and the<a href="http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/"> Royal British Columbia Museum</a>. Archibald conducted the research for his doctoral dissertation at Harvard, where Farrell was his adviser.</p>
<p>Farrell, Archibald, and colleagues engaged in a kind of time travel, invoking the fossil record to solve the conundrum of biodiversity. They compared modern insect diversity at the <a href="http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Forest</a> in Petersham, Mass., and in a Costa Rican jungle against that seen at the 52.9 million-year-old McAbee fossil bed in British Columbia, noted for its exceptionally well preserved insects. At the time the McAbee fossils were created, Earth’s climate was far less seasonal at all latitudes, allowing tropical species such as palm trees and crocodiles to live in what is now the high Arctic.</p>
<p>The scientists’ discovery that the ancient Canadian site’s insect diversity mirrors that of the modern Costa Rican jungle, despite a marked difference in latitude, suggests that it’s seasonality, not heat or light, that drives biodiversity.</p>
<p>“Planet Earth and life have co-evolved for well over a billion years, and this is yet additional evidence of the consequent intertwining of global physical and biological phenomena,” Farrell says.</p>
<p>Farrell and Archibald’s co-authors on the Paleobiology paper are <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~biophys/William_H_Bossert.htm">William H. Bossert</a> of Harvard’s <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> and <a href="http://www2.brandonu.ca/academic/environmental/greenwood.htm">David R. Greenwood </a>of Brandon University.

		<description><![CDATA[Test could predict which children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia are best candidates for clinical trials of new therapies, research finds.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A genetic clue uncovered by Harvard researchers at <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a> enables doctors to predict, for the first time, which children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are unlikely to benefit from standard chemotherapy for the disease and should therefore be among the first to receive new treatments in future clinical trials.</p>
<p>In a study in the<a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/"> Journal of Clinical Oncology</a>, which was published online today  (July 19), the investigators report that young people with T-ALL whose leukemia cells harbor an intact TCR-gamma gene generally have a poor response to &#8220;induction&#8221; chemotherapy — the first course of drugs given at the time of diagnosis to spur cancer remission. Patients with this high-risk marker will be prime candidates for clinical trials in which therapies currently in development are tested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though we can cure a large subset of children with T-ALL, about 25 percent of pediatric patients with the disease die of it, either because first-line chemotherapy fails, or because they relapse after being in remission for a year or two,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s lead author, <a href="http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/PROFILES/ProfileDetails.aspx?Person=AG73">Alejandro Gutierrez</a>, a <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/programs/harvard-medical-school">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS) instructor in pediatrics at Dana-Farber. &#8220;Until now, there has been no way of determining ahead of time whether a patient is likely to be helped by the standard regimen of front-line drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>ALL, a cancer of the white blood cells, is the <a href="http://physicians.dana-farber.org/directory/profile.asp?dbase=main&amp;setsize=10&amp;display=Y&amp;nxtfmt=r&amp;gs=r&amp;picture_id=0000172&amp;lookup=Y&amp;pict_id=0000172">most common malignancy</a> in children. T-ALL, which affects lymphocytes (lymph cells) known as T cells, accounts for about 15 percent of all pediatric ALL cases, or about 1,500 new diagnoses annually in the United States, according to the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/index">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>
<p>To see if T-ALL cells contain any hints of their likelihood to resist traditional chemotherapy, investigators performed genomic tests on leukemia cells from 47 children with T-ALL, 25 of whom were long-term survivors, nine of whom failed to achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy, and 13 who relapsed after going into remission.  The molecular test, known as comparative genomic hybridization, probes thousands of genes to see if any are present in unusual quantities in the cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that patients whose cells did not have rearranged DNA in the TCR-gamma gene were the most likely to fail induction therapy. Of the 47 samples studied, eight had this particular high-risk marker. Six of those patients did not respond to first-line chemotherapy,&#8221; said Gutierrez<a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp"></a>.</p>
<p>Tumor samples from patients whose disease relapsed after going into remission were found to have TCR-gamma rearrangements at the time of diagnosis.  In some of these patients, however, rearrangements were not found after relapse.  Researchers believe that such patients almost certainly had a small number of leukemia-initiating cells without rearrangements at diagnosis, but in quantities too small for detection, said the study’s senior author, <a href="http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/membership/profile/member/734/0/">A. Thomas Look, </a>an HMS pediatrics professor at Dana-Farber. After the DNA-rearranged cells died in response to chemotherapy, the remaining chemo-resistant cells came to predominate.</p>
<p>Other molecular studies are giving scientists leads as to which genes and gene pathways are responsible for the ability of some T-ALL cells to defy conventional chemotherapy, said Gutierrez. Some of these genes are known to be targeted by drugs currently being studied in clinical trials for other diseases, raising the possibility that they might be effective for certain T-ALL patients as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the relatively high failure rate of conventional induction therapy for this disease, there is an urgent need to test alternative chemotherapy agents in patients,&#8221; Gutierrez remarked.  &#8220;Routine testing for rearrangements in TCR-gamma,&#8221; which could be accomplished fairly inexpensively with a standardized test, &#8220;would enable us to identify which patients could gain the most benefit from these agents.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.damonrunyon.org/">Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization focused on supporting exceptional early-career researchers and innovative cancer research, has selected six Harvard affiliates to receive Damon Runyon fellowships.</p>
<p>The 18 total recipients of this prestigious three-year award are outstanding postdoctoral scientists conducting basic and translational cancer research in the laboratories of leading senior investigators across the country. The fellowship encourages the nation’s most promising young scientists to pursue careers in cancer research by providing them with independent funding ($156,000 each) to work on innovative projects. The recipients were announced at the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation’s spring Fellowship Award Committee review.</p>
<p>The fellows and their areas of studies are listed below:</p>
<p>Niels Bradshaw, with his sponsor Richard M. Losick, at Harvard University, is studying the regulation of an enzyme called protein phosphatase that acts in specific cells to promote cellular differentiation. Protein phosphatases are required for many processes, including cell growth, division, differentiation, and stress adaptation. Bradshaw hopes that understanding phosphatase regulation will clarify the role of these enzymes in cancer and potentially aid in the development of anti-cancer therapies that target phosphatases.</p>
<p>Sujun Hua, with his sponsor Ronald A. DePinho, at Harvard-affiliated <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>, aims to complete a comprehensive, genomewide assessment of regulatory networks governing self-renewal and fate-determination programs in normal and malignant neural stem cells. Tumor progression of certain tumor types, including glioblastoma, depends on a subpopulation of cells within the tumor called tumor stem cells. Understanding the shared and distinct features of normal and malignant stem cells is critical to develop novel therapies that selectively target tumor stem cells but spare their normal counterparts.</p>
<p>Kristin A. Krukenberg, with her sponsor Timothy J. Mitchison, at <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), is studying the role of a molecule called poly(ADP-ribose) in cell division and mitotic spindle formation. By understanding poly(ADP-ribose) function and regulation in both cancer and noncancer cells, she will investigate new avenues for the design of more effective and selective cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>John R. Lydeard, with his sponsor Jeffrey W. Harper, at HMS, is interested in studying how proteins are targeted for destruction. Defects in maintaining the balance between newly made proteins and those to be destroyed are often linked with cancer progression. Better understanding of how these processes are regulated will help to develop more effective anticancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>Ian Y. Wong, with his sponsors Mehmet Toner and Daniel Irimia, at Harvard-affiliated <a href="http://www.mgh.harvard.edu/">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, is developing a new experimental platform for characterizing how cancer cells migrate in response to biochemical signals and 3-D structural architectures. This approach may yield novel insights into how malignant cancer cells invade, which would aid the development of anti-metastatic therapies.</p>
<p>Dong Yan, with his sponsor Norbert Perrimon, at HMS, is aiming to generate profiles of phosphorylation for each kinase and phosphatase enzyme in the genome, and to relate these profiles to their in vivo functions during development. Given the large number of kinase mutations associated with various cancers, understanding the phosphorylation network could prompt treatment tailored to aberrant signaling of specific pathways.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a> (HLS) Professor <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=106">Jonathan Zittrain</a> ’95, a leading scholar on the legal and policy issues surrounding the Internet, has been appointed to the faculty of the Harvard <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> (SEAS) as professor of computer science. Zittrain is a co-founder of the University’s <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>.</p>
<p>“Jonathan’s appointment is a critical step in fostering stronger ties between HLS and SEAS,” said SEAS Dean <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/camurray">Cherry A. Murray</a>, the John A. and Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences and professor of physics. “Given the complexities of issues such as the security and privacy of data and medical records, open access scholarship, and the changing nature of digital identities — from social networks to gaming avatars — understanding the connections between law and technology is increasingly important. We believe that by leveraging the strengths of both our Schools, Harvard will become a leading player in this exciting interface.”</p>
<p>The author of “<a href="http://futureoftheinternet.org/">The Future of the Internet — And How to Stop It</a>,” Zittrain’s scholarly work bridges theory and experiment, prototyping tools for and on the Internet. His concept of the shifting roles of public and private institutions is the intellectual underpinning for <a href="http://www.stopbadware.org/">StopBadware</a>, a large-scale empirical study of the flow of Internet malware online.</p>
<p>“I am delighted that through Jonathan’s work, we are able to foster strengthened ties to the Engineering School,” said HLS Dean <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=45">Martha Minow</a>. “Jonathan’s work has long drawn upon his background in computer science, and his groundbreaking analysis combines legal, political, and technological analyses in helping to shape and reassess the quickly changing field of cyberlaw. His new appointment to SEAS strengthens his work, offers new opportunities for collaborations between our Schools, and deepens Harvard’s commitments to creative and comprehensive thinking about the challenges and opportunities of this digital age.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A group of college undergraduates from around the country took part in a weeklong summer program at Harvard Business School in June designed to help them explore the business school environment through the HBS case method.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They are talented, driven, dedicated, and largely underrepresented in corporate America.</p>
<p>Many are the first in their families to go to college, some come from single-parent households, others are thousands of miles from their homelands. For some, English is not their first language. Together they represent the changing face of the traditional executive in the United States.</p>
<p>The business stars of tomorrow were at <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/">Harvard Business School</a> (HBS) last month exploring what many hope is the next stop on the road to a business career through the help of a weeklong summer program that lets them try on the role of an HBS M.B.A. candidate.</p>
<p>Launched in 1983, the HBS <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/svmp/">Summer Venture in Management Program</a> (SVMP) is a management-training program for rising college seniors designed to increase diversity and opportunity in business education. Students are nominated for the program by sponsoring organizations where they have secured summer internships. Those recommendations, as well as the students’ academic records, leadership ability, and personal characteristics, are all factored into the admissions process.</p>
<p>Associate Director of M.B.A. Admissions Pauline Jennett, who helps oversee the program, explained, &#8220;Through SVMP, HBS has long been a leader in introducing talented students from a wide range of backgrounds to a business school environment. Our goal is to broaden their range of experience. As a result, they may add an option to their future plans — applying to business school here or elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Tradell Hawkins, who recently completed his junior year at <a href="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State</a>, where he majors in social relations and policy with a business minor, smiled broadly as he captured shots of the verdant HBS campus on his HD recorder and camera. A product of the high-tech-savvy generation, Hawkins, who loves to network on Facebook and Twitter, hopes to work with a company that uses social media to market to consumers.</p>
<p>After only one day of exposure to case studies, the Business School’s famed method of instruction, the young Chicago native was in awe. Previously unfamiliar with the interactive classroom format, Hawkins was reeling from the heady discussions examining corporate giants like <a href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/">Coca-Cola</a> and<a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/"> Ikea</a>, and the close interaction he had in class with HBS professors.</p>
<p>“It was great to read those cases and experience the thought process. I hadn’t thought about [those companies’] brand management styles and contracts with different suppliers,” he said, adding, “the professors are so passionate, and they are so knowledgeable about everything — it really inspires you.”</p>
<p>When the program was over, Hawkins said his SVMP experience had both solidified his decision to work in the corporate world and expanded his outlook on a business career.</p>
<p>“It allowed me to think beyond moving up the corporate ladder in a Fortune 500 company, to consider more broadly the contribution I want to make in the world. The cases reminded me of the impact business decisions can have on developing countries and individual human lives, which inspired me to think more in depth about what kind of company I want to work for.”</p>
<p>Asked if he hopes to attend HBS, he replied simply, “Yes, indeed.”</p>
<p>From Puerto Rico, Cerlienne Menéndez Mendoza cried uncontrollably when she received the e-mail confirming her acceptance to the program. She said she thought she was dreaming as she walked through the School’s impressive Baker Library/Bloomberg Center on a sunny summer afternoon.</p>
<p>“I still can’t believe I am here; I am in shock. I am still waiting to get an e-mail saying it was all a joke.”</p>
<p>But she was well aware that the demanding schedule is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>For five days students take part in intense interactive, debate-and-dialogue classes where arriving unprepared and unfamiliar with the day’s material is not an option. They explore actual business dilemmas and take on the role of executives dealing with critical decisions.</p>
<p>When not in class, they spend their time reading cases and participating in small study groups to prepare for the fast-paced discussions, acting every bit the part of an actual M.B.A. candidate with a full load of HBS cases to read during the week.</p>
<p>Led by the program’s faculty chair, <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/besty/">Ben Esty</a>, the School’s Roy and Elizabeth Simmons Professor of Business Administration, nine HBS faculty members representing a wide range of fields — from marketing to technology and operations management — taught the 69 SVMP students in an Aldrich Hall classroom.</p>
<p>The challenging pace came with big payoffs for Mendoza, who has dreams of starting a nonprofit that will help underserved children finish high school and prepare for college.</p>
<p>A junior at <a href="http://www.assumption.edu/">Assumption College</a>, where she is pursuing a triple major in accounting, political science, and Latin American studies, Mendoza attended the SVMP program to determine if applying to HBS would be a good option for her post-college. After completing the intense SVMP week at HBS, she had her answer. She will begin the application process this fall.</p>
<p>Calling the experience “life-changing,” Mendoza said the HBS program, with its varied cases on topics like China, basketball superstar LeBron James, and the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, helped her consider other career sectors and to hone her critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>“It made me think about the repercussions of every decision we make while trying to help someone. It made me think about the fact that in life, as well as in business, there will not always be a ‘right answer’ but the ‘best answer.’”</p>
<p>Additionally, Mendoza, like many of the program’s participants, said the chance to network with such an ambitious and intelligent group of peers was a vital part of the program.</p>
<p>“We all worked together &#8230; to get the best out of this experience. In the process we have made friendships that I know will last us a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Aleksey Chernobelskiy came to the United States from Russia with his parents, who were hoping for a better life for their two young sons. They moved, he said, “to be part of the American dream.”</p>
<p>Teased as a boy for his poor English skills, the Moscow native was determined to prove his tormentors wrong and make it to the very top.</p>
<p>Last month he did — by winning a spot in the weeklong program at HBS, where he studied cases in the same way business students do.</p>
<p>With a double major in finance and accounting and a minor in math and economics at the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>’s <a href="http://www.eller.arizona.edu/">Eller College of Management</a>, Chernobelskiy arrived at HBS interested in a slightly different track from most of his counterparts. Instead of working in corporate America, he hopes to teach future executives about finance, at HBS, to be exact.</p>
<p>“I really wanted to experience the teaching style at Harvard Business School, which was really important to me. To say that I was impressed is an understatement,” he said early in the week, adding, “This was literally my biggest dream. … I can’t even sleep at night.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the program, Chernobelskiy said the experience had confirmed his lifelong desire to pursue an advanced degree at the School.</p>
<p>“Harvard Business School,” he said, “is my number one choice.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the three years since its inception, the volunteer Green Team at the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Graduate School of Education</a> — 15 students, faculty, and staff — has made significant strides. Beyond the Larsen classroom project, the Green Team has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launched a recycling program that includes clearly labeled and conveniently located recycling bins throughout the campus. Additional efforts focus on improving recycling in the café, common areas, and offices.</li>
<li>Started a sustainable food-service program, using materials that are compostable as well as reusable. One highlight: The exclusive use of organic coffee.</li>
<li>Diverted more than 200 gallons of food scraps and paperware to composting bins during Commencement 2010.</li>
<li>Overseen sustainable facility improvements. The installation of low-flow restroom fixtures saved 800,000 gallons of water last year (2009). The conversion of the Longfellow Hall boiler from oil to natural gas reduced the campus carbon footprint. (The conversion was a coordinated effort with the adjacent Radcliffe campus and University Operations Services.) The School won a <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/greencarpet">Harvard University Green Carpet Team Award</a> for this project.</li>
<li>Installed solar panels on the roof of the Gutman Library. This is the School’s first renewable energy project, and will help reduce the School&#8217;s annual electricity use.</li>
<li>Started Green Team campaigns. Included are an annual freecycle event; zero-waste events; composting programs; and a &#8220;Green Your Scene&#8221; campaign — public service announcements to encourage students, faculty, and staff to make environmentally conscious decisions.</li>
<li>Recorded the highest percent participation in the Sustainability Pledge administered by <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/">Harvard’s Office for Sustainability</a>.</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[Two floors of classrooms in Larsen Hall at the Harvard Graduate School of Education are the first in the world to win the highest LEED-CI rating.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call it a class act.</p>
<p>Three renovated classrooms in Larsen Hall have received the highest sustainability rating there is — Platinum — from the <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/">U.S. Green Building Council</a>.</p>
<p>The rating, awarded earlier this month (July), makes these <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Graduate School of Education</a> (HGSE) classrooms the first LEED-CI Platinum classrooms in the world.</p>
<p>After six months of design work and planning, the renovations were started last summer and completed in October. What was once a two-floor warren of small offices is now space for three classrooms that are muted and serene.</p>
<p>“A lot of planning went into this,” said <a href="http://gseweb.harvard.edu/about/directory/listing.shtml?vperson_id=78156">Jason Carlson</a>, director of operations at HGSE, who also directs the School’s 15-member volunteer Green Team.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leed.us/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988">LEED</a> stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a certification system for green buildings used in more than 30 countries. The Platinum rating is the highest, and the hardest to attain.</p>
<p>In the case of the Larsen renovations, “CI” stands for “commercial interior,” a rating system that focuses on interior improvements of new or existing space. Other LEED ratings are for new buildings.</p>
<p>The Platinum LEED certification required a complete makeover of lighting, electrical, heating, cooling, and ventilation systems on Larsen’s first and second floors — all with an eye to reducing energy use, water use, and construction waste.</p>
<p>The materials used were vetted according to recycled content, origin, and environmental health considerations. About 80 percent of the wood for trim and desks, for instance, is ash from forests that are certified to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Of all the materials used, 25 percent (by cost) came from no more than 500 miles away, reducing the energy needed to transport them. Another 23 percent — including furniture, carpet, and acoustic surfaces — contain recycled content. In the hallways, all surfaces are made of <a href="http://www.paperstoneproducts.com/">PaperStone</a>, the 100-percent recycled product called the “countertop with a conscience.”</p>
<p>All paints and adhesives in the classroom spaces are “low VOC” — that is, low in the volatile organic compounds associated with degraded indoor air quality.</p>
<p>And all three rooms — with capacity for 50, 60, and 80 students — are fitted with occupancy and CO2 sensors that adjust heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation. Reduced wattage requirements for lighting alone means the Larsen space is 28 percent more efficient than code.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency measures at Larsen will reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of the building by an estimated 5 percent.</p>
<p>All these steps “really breathed new life into this building,” said Carlson. He called the Platinum designation “a tremendous honor and a result of the collaborative effort of the entire project team.”</p>
<p>Working with Carlson on the Larsen project was <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/ofs/staff">Andrea Ruedy Trimble</a>, manager of green building services for Harvard’s <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/">Office for Sustainability</a> (OFS).</p>
<p>“The Larsen project set very ambitious sustainability goals around lighting efficiency and quality,” said OFS assistant director <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/about/faculty/nathan-t-gauthier.jsp;jsessionid=LBBJNODOBIDE">Nathan Gauthier</a>. “This project is a model for lighting design in a classroom building and will be influential in the design of all future classrooms.”</p>
<p>The Larsen classroom renovation project required tearing the first two floors of Larsen right back to the walls.</p>
<p>The new ground-floor classroom has 80 seats in tiered rows. Shades move up and down to harvest daylight. On the next floor up is one classroom of 50 tiered seats, and another classroom —“breakout space” — that can accommodate up to 60 students in six groups.</p>
<p>“The faculty are thrilled,” said Carlson, who is also a veteran of LEED renovations at Harvard Business School. “This is a much-needed space on campus. It enhances the learning experience.”</p>
<p>The LEED-certified classrooms are also a learning experience for facilities managers at Harvard, he added, where cross-School lessons in sustainability are already “iterative and constant.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, said Carlson, the new classroom spaces “support the learning experience of future educators, researchers, and policymakers.”</p>
<p>Larsen Hall, a handsome red brick building constructed in 1965, is used for classrooms, offices, and research space. It was named after education reformer Roy E. Larsen ’21, a founder and chairman of Time<em> </em>magazine and other publications.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A rare and curious plant from Sumatra’s rainforest has bloomed at Harvard. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The elusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_arum">titan arum</a><em> </em>is a prehistoric sight. The unusual plant, housed at the greenhouse at the Biological Laboratories building, is more than 4 feet tall with a skyward-jutting branch called an inflorescence that’s more reptilian than tabletop bouquet.</p>
<p>Blooming began on Sunday (July 11), and on Monday the oddity sent flocks of Harvard employees across campus to witness the phenomenon. <a href="http://zatoichi.huh.harvard.edu/people/index.php?personid=821&amp;area=Research%22">Douglas Goldman,</a> an associate at the <a href="http://www.huh.harvard.edu/">Harvard University Herbaria</a>, was on site to explain the plant’s origin. Indigenous only to the rainforests of Sumatra, the plant was germinated at the <a href="http://www.uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> in 1995 and brought to Harvard by Goldman in 2002.</p>
<p>This is the first time it’s bloomed in its eight-year stay at Harvard, he revealed. But that’s not necessarily a good thing. When blooming, the plant releases a putrid fragrance — like that of rotting meat. The scent is meant to attract flies, which then pollinate the plant.</p>
<p>Titan arum’s scientific name — <em>Amorphophallus titanum — </em>refers to the plant’s extraordinary inflorescence.</p>
<p>Lasting only a few days before dying, the inflorescence can reach over 10 feet in circumference and 8 to 9 feet in height. But greenhouse staff intentionally kept this specimen on the small side. By using a smaller pot, the plant’s growth is restricted.</p>
<p>Goldman plans to cut up the plant and store it as a specimen in the <a href="http://www.huh.harvard.edu/">Harvard Herbaria’s</a> vast holdings. However, the titan arum will live on. The corm — its underground spherical stem — will produce another structure yet, which Goldman hopes will bloom again … in another five years.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Partners In Health, the Boston-based global health initiative that has been the face of health care in Haiti after the devastating earthquake six months ago, is building a new teaching hospital there.</p>
<p>The 320-bed, seven-building hospital will rise in Mirebalais in the rural Central Plateau, a 45-minute drive from the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, the hard-hit capital. It will become a national referral center when it opens at the end of next year, seeing as many patients as are seen at the other 12 clinics in Haiti where Partners in Health currently works…</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Oberon, the American Repertory Theater’s sister theater space, is turning up the volume with its summer schedule.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was your typical night at <a href="http://www.cluboberon.com/">Oberon</a>: a packed house belting the lyrics to the perennial pop gem “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_%28Toto_song%29">Africa</a>” by the band Toto.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t karaoke. It was a reading by the Arlington, Mass.-based writer <a href="http://www.stevenalmond.com/">Steve Almond</a>, author of several books including “Candyfreak,” “My Life in Heavy Metal,” and his most recent work — and the event’s namesake — “Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life.”</p>
<p>The book is Almond’s love letter to music, of which he confesses he’s a “drooling fanatic,” and Oberon was a befitting space for the avant-garde production that featured audience participation and concluded with a performance by singer-songwriter Dayna Kurtz.</p>
<p>The year-old Oberon, which houses the popular disco spectacular <a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/donkey-show">“The Donkey Show,”</a> is the younger sister of Harvard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/">American Repertory Theater</a> (A.R.T.). Formerly the Zero Arrow Theatre, Oberon was the vision of A.R.T. Artistic Director <a href="http://www.dianepaulus.net/">Diane Paulus</a>, who sought to turn the venue into a permanent nightclub theater, according to Ari Barbanell, Oberon’s associate producer.</p>
<p>“This new venture was one of our main initiatives to further the A.R.T.’s core mission to expand the boundaries of theater,” said Barbanell.</p>
<p>“Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life” is just one of the diverse performances Oberon is offering this summer. Oberon’s docket includes, for example, “<a href="http://www.avantgarderestaurant.com/">Conni’s Avant-Garde Restaurant</a>,” which presents guests with a five-course home-cooked dinner set to dance, music, and more; and “<a href="http://www.cluboberon.com/shows.html#network">The Other Network</a>,” which showcases previously unseen TV shows by Conan O’Brien, Ben Stiller, and Judd Apatow, starring Jack Black, Adam West, Amy Poehler, Owen Wilson, Ron Silver, Jason Segel, and others.</p>
<p>“Oberon is committed to presenting work that fits into the world of ‘club theater’ that a show like ‘The Donkey Show’ has begun drawing attention to,” said James Wetzel, programming associate at Oberon. “We look for work that promotes a social atmosphere, works well in a bar environment, and gets audiences up and moving. This is what makes Oberon stand out. Not only are we helping local artists cultivate their work and talents, we also encourage them and their audiences to come into the venue, have a great time, and push the boundaries of theater.”</p>
<p>Drink, sing, and dance. Those three “rules for the evening” were projected on a screen over the stage during Almond’s show, highlights of which included a close reading of the lyrics of “Africa,” and the author’s waxing about records (“they were large, pitched to the scale of their emotional importance”) and his favorite songs (“the sheer gypsy longing of ‘Rhiannon’ by Fleetwood Mac made me feel like a gypsy, too”).</p>
<p>Other summer shows include “Uhuru Afrika Jump!” — a “jumping afro-diasporic dance floor explosion”; “Bent Wit Cabaret,” a “high-end, low-brow variety show” with a different theme each month and a brilliant core cast of collaborating performers and musicians; and “Abbey Road: A Sugar Coated Production” that promises an unforgettable interpretation of the classic Beatles album.</p>
<p>“The great thing about the programming schedule we have here at Oberon is that it is never the same,” said Wetzel. “We accept submissions from performance groups and also seek out interesting work in Cambridge, Boston, and beyond.”</p>
<p>This past spring, Oberon was one of the homes to the first <a href="http://www.emergingamericafestival.org/">Emerging America Festival</a>, a collaboration among the A.R.T., the <a href="http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/">Huntington Theatre</a>, and the <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/">ICA/Boston</a> to present new American performances.</p>
<p>“The A.R.T. hosted six different companies over two days in Oberon, each working in a different style of club theater,” said Barbanell. “It was a great representation of the kind of work Oberon is proud to share.”</p>
<p>This fall, Oberon will present the first show of the A.R.T.’s 2010-11 season, the musical “<a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/cabaret">Cabaret</a>” directed by Steven Bogart. In February, says Barbanell, the A.R.T.’s production of “<a href="http://www.americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/prometheus-bound">Prometheus Bound</a>” will premiere.</p>
<p>The musical, directed by Paulus and written by Steven Sater with music by Serj Tankian from the band System of a Down, continues the venue’s outrageous legacy.</p>
<p>“The dance floor of Oberon will become a mosh pit,” revealed Barbanell. “It’s going to be amazing!”</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> announced today (July 12) the appointment of Anne H. Margulies as chief information officer.</p>
<p>A senior manager with 30 years of strategic planning, information technology, and administrative leadership experience, Margulies is currently assistant secretary for information technology and CIO for the state of Massachusetts. This will be her second stint at Harvard. She served as assistant provost and executive director for information systems from 1995 through 1998.</p>
<p>Margulies takes on a reconfigured CIO role that will provide leadership for applied technologies that support the University’s teaching and research mission, in addition to having direct oversight of the technology functions of the <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/">Faculty of Arts and Sciences</a> (FAS). Working with senior academic and administrative leaders and with technology professionals across the institution, she will provide strategic leadership, technical planning, and organizational management of technology programs that focus on the University’s academic, administrative, and infrastructure technology needs.</p>
<p>“This is a critical piece of our effort to better organize and utilize University resources and create efficiencies across campus,” said Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp. “These two IT departments have developed separately over time, and it only makes sense to ensure that they are working in concert.”</p>
<p>Margulies will report to Lapp on most technology-related matters and to the FAS dean on matters related to the academic and research computing needs in that area. She also will coordinate with the <a href="http://www.provost.harvard.edu/">Office of the Provost</a> on technology matters related to the University’s overall academic mission.</p>
<p>“As dean, I am committed to providing our faculty and students with the most effective support and compelling tools available,” said FAS Dean <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/dean-and-administration/deans-office/deans-biography.shtml">Michael D. Smith</a>, the John H. Finley Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>“Today, information technology is not only a backbone of our daily lives, but also a critical component of cutting-edge education, research, and administration,” he said. “I am excited by Anne&#8217;s return to Harvard, as she brings a wealth of experience and a demonstrated ability to apply technology and build organizations that will help bolster our mission of teaching and research.”</p>
<p>Margulies will assume her position in early September.</p>
<p>“No one doubts that information technology is playing an increasingly important role in education and research everywhere. From my discussions with many faculty and senior leaders across Harvard, it is clear that the University is ready to chart a new course for its own IT future,” Margulies said. “I am very excited about the opportunity to work with faculty, students, and staff to formulate an innovative vision for IT that is right for Harvard, and to make it a reality.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://hcag.org.au/">Harvard Club of Australia Foundation</a> is accepting applications for its 2011 Australia-Harvard Fellowship program, which awards midcareer and senior Harvard-based science and technology researchers intending collaborative projects in Australia. The deadline for applications is Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Fellows typically visit Australia for several months and interact with educators and students in their vicinity. An option favored by senior applicants is a shorter visit, but one that enables them to take a primary role in a seminar or instructional course open to Australians working in the fellow’s specialized field. Taking a sabbatical to accommodate longer studies is also an option. Fellowship grants are donated Australian institutions hosting the fellows, and those institutions administer the funds on standard terms.</p>
<p>The Australia-Harvard Fellowships were introduced in 2005 and to date have been awarded to 28 fellows.</p>
<p>For more information and to apply, visit the <a href="http://hcag.org.au/Australia-Harvard_Fellowship.html">Web site</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[At 50, a durable “To Kill a Mockingbird” still has power to enthrall.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 1960 — 50 years ago this weekend — the novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” appeared in bookstores for the first time.</p>
<p>In the decades since, author Harper Lee’s iconic novel of race, class, courage, gender, and moral complexity has never been out of print. The instant classic went on to be published around the world in more than 5,000 editions.</p>
<p>What has made the story of Atticus Finch, Scout, Jem, Dill, and the doomed Tom Robinson so durable? A few Harvard professors weighed in on the novel, set in sleepy Maycomb, Ala., in the 1930s. The people moved slowly, Lee wrote, grass grew in the sidewalks, and “men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning.”</p>
<p>But fictional little Maycomb was also a place where racial tension simmered like summer heat — a place that Lee invented just as the American Civil Rights movement flowered. “To Kill a Mockingbird” — which soon won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Oscar-winning film — became the bestseller that summed up the moral quandaries of a race-charged age.</p>
<p>“It was a landmark book,” said <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty_research/profiles/profile.shtml?vperson_id=107">Vicki A. Jacobs</a>, associate director of the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/~tep/">Teacher Education Program</a> at the <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Graduate School of Education</a>. “The themes are universal, despite time.”</p>
<p>One of those themes is self-realization, she said, the journey to moral and social awareness that Jem and Scout make as children confronted with the tragic consequences of Maycomb’s fragile racial climate.</p>
<p>“ ‘Lord of the Rings’ endures, Shakespeare endures,” said Jacobs, a specialist in literacy, curriculum, and the teaching of English. “It’s all about a basic struggle.”</p>
<p>“To Kill a Mockingbird” was one of the first novels in a new canon of books that represented a diversity of voices, and that children gladly read, she said. It still resonates today at least as a social document from a time when Americans struggled as a nation with the moral dilemma of race relations. “I’m more interested in it as a piece of history,” said Jacobs. “It’s more of a book I carry emotionally.”</p>
<p>In the book, much to the surprise of his children Jem and Scout, the mild and quiet Atticus shoulders a rifle, and expertly shoots down a mad dog roaming the streets of Maycomb. In the courtroom later — defending Robinson from trumped-up rape charges — Atticus takes aim at what critics have called the “mad dog” of racial prejudice.</p>
<p>But it’s not such an easy shot. Robinson, one of the innocent “mockingbirds” of the title, is convicted despite porous evidence, and is eventually shot dead while trying to escape. He’s the victim of racism’s mad dog.</p>
<p>“Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom’s jury,” Atticus said later, “but you saw something come between them and reason. … There’s something in our world that makes men lose their heads — they couldn’t be fair if they tried.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.summer.harvard.edu/courses/faculty/s_u.jsp">James Simpson</a>, Harvard College Professor and Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Professor of English, grew up in Australia. But in his childhood, “To Kill a Mockingbird” still made itself felt on the other side of a great geographic and cultural divide.</p>
<p>“Even way down there in Melbourne, the book cast its potent spell over generations of schoolchildren,” said Simpson, who also chairs the <a href="http://english.fas.harvard.edu/">English Department</a>, “evoking and half calming their anxieties about that spooky, silent house on the corner that every child fears.”</p>
<p>The book also delivered a very American message. “ ‘Catcher in the Rye’ brought America to Melbourne adolescents by a mesmerizing voice,” said Simpson. “But ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ brought America to Melbourne through something much deeper — a palpable atmosphere of dark and troubling pasts, all unlike anything we knew.”</p>
<p>Lee’s classic was not life-changing to <a href="http://aaas.fas.harvard.edu/faculty/walter_johnson/index.html">Walter Johnson</a>, Winthrop Professor of History at Harvard, and a professor of African and African-American studies. For that power, he prefers Anne Moody’s “Coming of Age in Mississippi.” The 1968 memoir follows a black woman through the humiliation of the Jim Crow era and the turbulence of the civil rights struggle.</p>
<p>As for “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “its moral center resides in a white male redeemer,” said Johnson, who studies 19th century American slavery, capitalism, and imperialism. “That might account for some of its popularity and longevity, [but] it also defines and — to an extent — limits its moral and ethical vision.”</p>
<p>Like the movie “Amistad,” the novel’s moral focus seems racially one-sided, he said. “Both the strength and the weakness of the book is that it is, in the end, a book about white people.”</p>
<p>Will its rugged popularity in the classroom last? “To Kill a Mockingbird” may not always be a feature in that canon of books still taught in high schools and middle schools, said Jacobs. But for now, “it still has its place,” she said, and her students regularly choose it when teaching their English classes.</p>
<p>Simpson had greater hopes for Lee’s classic. “May books like this one,” he said, “continue to live much longer.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Master swimmers will race in the Charles River, where one Harvard professor sees an opportunity for lessons.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/people/faculty/belanger/">Pierre Bélanger</a> is a scholar of landscape, infrastructure, and urbanism at Harvard’s <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/">Graduate School of Design</a>. But this Sunday (July 11), the associate professor will trade his books and maps for a bathing suit to join 100 other master swimmers in a mile race in the Charles River.</p>
<p>It’s an event that defies an old local story: that you swim in the Charles only to get out of it.</p>
<p>To Bélanger, an open-water swimmer for 10 years, the race is a chance to celebrate the river’s ecological comeback, and to raise awareness about preserving fresh water resources everywhere. “The future of clean water,” he said, “is the future of civilization.”</p>
<p>Bélanger, whose research revolves around clean drinking water and urban rivers, looks forward to the day when a public resource can be used regularly by the public — a day when you can “see thousands of swimmers on the waterfront of the Charles River,” he said, “and not just people sprinting along on a Sunday.”</p>
<p>It is currently illegal to swim in the Charles without special permission.</p>
<p>Sunday’s race, which will include other Harvard entrants, is co-sponsored by the <a href="http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/">Charles River Conservancy</a>, a decade-old advocacy group based in Cambridge, and the <a href="http://www.charlesriverswimmingclub.org/wp/">Charles River Swimming Club</a>, founded in 2005.</p>
<p>The club’s major event is the annual race, open to swimmers 16 and older. One of its goals is to speed the return of public swimming to a body of water that the club Web site admits “has a speckled past.”</p>
<p>Bélanger, who grew up in Toronto, has long been aware of the importance of fresh water. His native region adjoins the Great Lakes, which make up about a quarter of the world’s freshwater resources.</p>
<p>The professor considers the Charles a wonderful asset, and sees the race as a strategy to make the river more visible as an ecological resource.</p>
<p>The Charles is an infrastructure just as important as roads and streets, said Bélanger. But he realizes that it may not be viewed this way, which is a main reason for his race participation.</p>
<p>“The race next Sunday is more than just a competition,” said Belanger. “It is a challenge to everyone in the city who looks, sees, watches, enjoys, lives near the water.”</p>
<p>It is imperative for the Harvard community to become more involved in Charles River research, said Bélanger, and in preserving the freshwater resources so close to the University.</p>
<p>Several factors could cancel Sunday’s race, including a stormwater overflow from expected rains or an increase in algae production based on the high temperatures that Boston has endured this week. But Bélanger remains optimistic it will take place.</p>
<p>His goal is to finish in under 12 minutes, though he says open-water swimming is “more about endurance and pace, not speed and sprinting.”</p>
<p>His long-term athletic goal? To swim across Lake Ontario, a distance of about 25 miles.</p>
<p>Bélanger looks forward to a growth spurt for the sport of open-water swimming. As for the Charles, he said: It will be a beautiful day when people can go outside and swim in it regularly.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[About 20 children participated in an interactive session at the Honan-Allston Branch Library that outlined the creation of Library Park, which is slated to open next year. Construction is to begin next week.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="initial-cap">I</span>t’s an exclusive club. Membership is hard to come by. Besides, it’s a lot of work.</p>
<p>Make that fun.</p>
<p>The Library Park Construction Club, an enthusiastic group of 7- to 10-year-olds, is taking the hands-on approach to watching its beloved <a href="http://www.bpl.org/branches/allston.htm">Honan-Allston Branch Library</a> get a facelift.</p>
<p>About 20 kids braved the afternoon’s heat yesterday (July 7) to visit their neighborhood library and take part in an interactive session that took them beyond the storied stacks of the library and into a vacant field behind it.</p>
<p>The field — a 1.74-acre of sun-scorched grass where a concrete plant used to sit — is about to become an inviting oasis of green through the creation of Library Park, slated to open next year. Construction is scheduled to begin next week with the help of Harvard University, its landscape architects and designers, and, of course, those local experts.</p>
<p>“Is it going to be like a playground?” asked one eager child as designers Dennis Swinford and <a href="http://www.mvvainc.com/index.php#/STAFF/29">Emily Mueller De Celis</a> showed the club architectural plans, including aerial photographs. “Is there going to be a fountain?” another asked. The park will be sort of like a playground, said Swinford, and there will be a fountain, the Harvard planner enthused. What’s a park without one?</p>
<p>“A park and a library work really well together,” said Mueller De Celis, a senior associate at <a href="http://www.mvvainc.com/index.php">Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates</a>. “We wanted to think about spaces where you could go and read a book.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people said the back part of the library isn’t that pretty,” said Swinford referring to feedback received from the community during the park design process. “So there will be flowers everywhere. This is going to be a special park.”</p>
<p>“There’ll be lots of trees, flowering trees like dogwoods, and multicolored plants,” added Mueller De Celis.</p>
<p>The park’s plans paint it as a large green space, with a hill, winding paths, seating, and open lawns for reading and gatherings. A rain garden is even incorporated, a dedicated area where all rainwater is collected into a stream that will feed plant systems thriving on wet roots.</p>
<p>Children’s librarian Sherry Eskin sees great potential in Library Park. “I think the park will provide a great educational space for story time and other programming. The library has a few courtyards, but it’s good to have more.”</p>
<p>Swinford and Mueller De Celis invited the club outside to imagine what the field will soon become. With a map of the future park, the kids used landscape markers to flag landmarks like the event lawn and an outdoor classroom.</p>
<p>This was the club’s first of six weekly sessions designed to introduce the children not only to the park, but to teach them about soil, trees, and other design and construction elements.</p>
<p>Friends Kristian Eskew and Ricky Ciliberto were excited about their new stomping ground. “We’ll come here often,” said Eskew.</p>
<p>“We just like to hang out and have fun,” added Ciliberto.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the kids were imagining big future plans for the park’s use.</p>
<p>“In this new park, I hope there’s lots of shade because it’s hot,” said 8-year-old Ava Healy. “The rain garden sounds really fun because I want to go in. And I might roll down the hill, and maybe I’ll read a book on the hill.”</p>
<p>The sessions take place Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m. at the Honan-Allston Branch Library through Aug. 11. Sign up in advance by calling 617.496.6688, or e-mail deirdre_keady@harvard.edu.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Study finds that maternal genes in mice predominate in the developing brain, while paternal genes gain the upper hand in adulthood. Researchers also find 1,300 imprinted genes in the brain, far more than previously known.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genome-wide analysis of mice brains has found that maternally inherited genes are expressed preferentially in the developing brain, while the pattern shifts decisively in favor of paternal influence by adulthood.</p>
<p>The study, led by <a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=catherine-dulac">Catherine Dulac</a> and <a href="http://golgi.harvard.edu/newsevents/news/Merck4.html">Christopher Gregg</a> at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> and described in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/journals/">Science</a>, identified 1,300 genes active in the mouse brain that show some degree of parental bias, greatly expanding on the 45 previously known “imprinted genes” expressed in the brain. Fewer than 100 imprinted genes had been known to exist in the body, suggesting they may be far more common than previously thought.</p>
<p>The new work helps in understanding genomic imprinting, through which each parent is thought to contribute genes nudging offspring development in a direction most favorable, and least costly, to the ultimate transmission of that parent’s genetic material. It contributes to scientists’ growing understanding of a subtle tug-of-war between genes inherited from the mother and the father that shapes the development of their offspring early in life, and may provide lasting parental influence well after birth, even into adulthood.</p>
<p>“Our work shows that parental bias in gene expression is a major mode of genetic regulation in the brain,” said Dulac, the Higgins Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard and an investigator with the <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>. “Despite tantalizing reports, our understanding of the neural systems governed by imprinted genes has been very limited.”</p>
<p>In studies of the brains of 15-day-old mice embryos as well as adult mice, Dulac and her colleagues found that about a quarter of brain regions are hotspots for expression of imprinted genes. Many of these genes are expressed in brain areas associated with feeding, mating, pain sensation, social interactions, and motivated behavior.</p>
<p>The work builds on previous research by co-author <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/haig/Home.html">David Haig</a>, the George Putnam Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. Haig’s analysis of rare genetic disorders has shown that certain maternal and paternal genes can clash well into childhood.</p>
<p>Other previous research had offered evidence of a genetic struggle for supremacy only during fetal development. In the womb, some genes of paternal origin have been shown to promote increased demands on mothers, leading to fetal overgrowth, while genes of maternal origin tend to have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>In the current study, Dulac and her colleagues found that 61 percent of imprinted genes in the fetal brain are maternal in origin, suggesting a major maternal influence over the brain development of offspring. By adulthood, the proportions are flipped. About 70 percent of imprinted genes in both the adult cortex and hypothalamus appear to derive from the father, suggesting a major paternal influence on the brain function of adult offspring.</p>
<p>This new work expands on the known timeline for the internal conflict between maternal and paternal genes. Maternal genes may predominate in fetal development, followed by a period of childhood where maternal and paternal genes tussle for control, followed by eventual bias in favor of paternal genes during adulthood.</p>
<p>The data also suggest a highly dynamic regulation of parental biases in gene expression during development and in the adult brain, which had not previously been anticipated, as the authors reported major differences in the parental influence exerted upon distinct brain regions.</p>
<p>In a second study published by Dulac and her colleagues in the same issue of Science, the authors report a preferential expression of the maternal versus paternal X chromosome in the cortex of females, demonstrating a maternal influence over the brain function of adult daughters through X-linked genes. This second study also uncovered the existence of sex-specific parental bias in gene expression that may shed new light into sex differences in brain function and disease susceptibility.</p>
<p>Dulac, Gregg, and Haig’s co-authors are Jiangwen Zhang, James Butler, and Brandon Weissbourd at Harvard, and Shujun Luo and Gary P. Schroth of Illumina Inc. of Hayward, Calif. The work was funded by the Klarman Family Foundation Grants Program in Eating Disorders Research, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Human Frontier Science Program, and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Miriah Myer, a postdoctoral fellow, is a computer scientist using technology to better model and clarify medical data.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miriah Meyer isn’t a biologist, but she helps biologists better   understand their work.</p>
<p>A postdoctoral research fellow in computer   science in Harvard’s <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/programs/school-engineering-and-applied-sciences">School   of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> (SEAS), Meyer spends her work   hours not at SEAS, but rather in a biology lab at <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/programs/harvard-medical-school">Harvard   Medical School</a>, learning how <a href="http://www.dnaftb.org/dnaftb/" target="_blank">DNA</a> affects  the development of  thousands of tiny cells inside fruit fly embryos.   She doesn’t  meticulously research and document each cell’s <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=geneexpression" target="_blank">gene  expression</a> profile. Instead, she uses her  expertise to reveal the  minute differences and similarities across many  species’ profiles to the  scientists who do the research.</p>
<p>“I love  immersing myself in a new  and different culture, whether that’s a  foreign country or a new  scientific field of research,” says Meyer.  “I  really enjoy learning  about new ideas and interactions, in both  societal and scientific  cultures.”</p>
<p>As a computer scientists,  Meyer specializes in the  emerging field of <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf0050/visualization/visualization.htm" target="_blank">visualization</a>,  which uses graphic computer  representations to help scientists and  others envision, manage, and  interact with large quantities of complex  data in ways that would  otherwise be impossible.</p>
<p>“In the last  decade biologists acquired  vast amounts of quantitative data, starting  with the sequencing of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/Doc/hs_genomeintro.html" target="_blank">human  genome</a>,” she explains.  “They’re essentially  swimming in this data —  well drowning in it, really.  It’s the perfect  time for a field like  visualization to make an impact and enable  scientists to make sense of  all this data.”</p>
<p>Meyer sees  visualization as the happy marriage of  art and science, of new  discovery and in-depth learning, of being a  sightseer and an architect  of new cultures.  It’s no surprise that she  is the daughter of an  artist mother and chemist father, who spent her  childhood both  sculpting clay and learning basic computing.</p>
<p>She  grew up  Powhatan, Va., a small town outside of Richmond, where she  attended a  school named after Pocahontas, another woman who bridged  cultures.   Math and science were her favorite subjects from an early  age, and she  earned a Bachelor’s degree in astronomy and astrophysics at  <a href="http://www.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania  State University</a>.</p>
<p>“I assumed  that I would go to grad school.   But at the time, I wasn’t focused  enough to study one thing for the rest  of my life.  I wasn’t ready  yet,” she says.  So she took a year off to  explore the world, traveling  to Australia, Mauritania, Thailand, Fiji,  Nepal and across the United  States.</p>
<p>Meyer moved to Massachusetts  in 2000 and began work as a  software engineer at <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/" target="_blank">Raytheon</a>. She  spent  evenings taking classes at <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/programs/harvard-extension-school">Harvard   Extension School</a>, where <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/researchers/hanspeter-pfister">Hanspeter   Pfister</a>, who is now the Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of   Computer Science in Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied   Sciences, was her computer graphics instructor. “It was literally after   that first week of class that I thought computer graphics was awesome   and I wanted to go to grad school for <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/faculty-research/research-areas/computer-science/" target="_blank">computer  science</a>,” Meyer says.</p>
<p>Meyer decided  to attend the <a href="http://www.utah.edu/portal/site/uuhome/" target="_blank">University   of Utah</a>, where she also worked in the <a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Scientific Computing and Imaging  Institute</a> and  earned a Ph.D. in computer science.  (Ironically, she  chose Utah  because of the rock climbing opportunities it offered, but  her first  week there she fell while climbing in an indoor facility,  injured her  knee, and never climbed again.) During her studies, Meyer  was drawn to  the field of visualization because it allowed her to  interact with the  scientific research community.  “It was a way to be  involved in science  without being the scientist doing the experiments  and observations,”  she says.</p>
<p>“As a global community, we have  tons of data, whether  medical, financial, or from scientific devices.   So, all this data,  underneath it’s just a bunch of numbers,” Meyer says,  adding that  visualization is a helpful tool in making sense of enormous  amounts of  data.  “As humans, our brains are like a computer with  limited memory.   So we can rely on the outside world as an external hard  drive.  We can  store all this information in diagrams or graphs or  whatever.  In  visualization, we rely on our perceptual system to be able  to see  patterns and see trends,” she says.</p>
<p>Her research in Utah  included  taking what is called volumetric data, from MRIs or CT scans,  and  mapping that data into interactive 3-D images for physicians.  Her  work  enabled doctors to see various layers and organs inside the human  body  more realistically, and interactively.   “I was really interested  in  doing more multidisciplinary work and working very closely with end   users.  Visualization is really about designing and developing <a href="http://iic.harvard.edu/%7Emiriah/publications/multimaterial_meshing.pdf" target="_blank">visual  encodings of data</a> to help scientists make  better sense of the  relationships within that data,” Meyer says.</p>
<p>Around  the time Meyer  completed her Ph.D., Pfister accepted a position at  SEAS, and was  looking for someone to do multidisciplinary research in  his lab.  Meyer  proved to be the person he was seeking.  “I assumed,  because I have an  astronomy degree, that I would be working with  physicists and physical  scientists.  But within the first two months of  my postdoc, I started  meeting biologists and found out that biology is  in the midst of a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf0050/visualization/alternative.htm" target="_blank">data  revolution </a>right now,” Meyer says, referring  to biological  breakthroughs including the decoding of mammalian  genomes, and  quantitative gene expression data.</p>
<p>Meyer began her  postdoctoral  research developing visual tools for biologists in the <a href="http://harvardscience.harvard.edu/directory/programs/department-systems-biology">Systems   Biology Department </a>at Harvard Medical School, helping them track   gene expression in 13 species of fruit fly embryos.  “One of the things   I’ve liked most is the Harvard community, and just being in Cambridge,   is that there’s so much interesting interdisciplinary science going  on,”  Meyer says.  “Once I started talking to one or two people, it just   blossomed.  I’m working in three different labs right now, on three   different projects, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>In   her collaborations, Meyer attempts a deep understanding her   collaborator’s research by spending time in their laboratories. “Having   an interest and a curiosity in other people and in what they do is what   attracted me to the work I do.  You get to work with other people and   talk with them about their own science and learn about what they do,”   she says.</p>
<p>Meyer calls on background as a traveler to understand   the relationships of data sets in complex scientific experiments, and   she synthesizes that knowledge into a visual and interactive   representation of the research data.  “There’s that same cultural   experience for me as a computer scientist going into a biology lab   that’s similar to what I love most about traveling to other places,” she   says.  “It’s very much like learning a new culture.”</p>
<p>She first   works with scientists to figure out what their goals are.  “A huge part   of what I do is to get inside the head of researchers to understand  what  they truly want to see out of their data.  Then I translate their  data  into a computer science language that I understand,” Meyer says.   She  then writes software and designs interactive computer tools that  process  the data, and converts it into interactive images.  Using her  tools,  scientists can rely on their <a href="http://www.infoviz.utah.edu/" target="_blank">perception,  rather than cognition</a>,  to more easily see patterns and trends.</p>
<p>For  example, when Meyer  clicks her computer’s mouse over a single fruit  fly cell represented on  her computer screen, a row automatically  appears showing an easily  discernable gene expression profile for that  specific cell at a  particular time point in the experiment.  There are  also links to  similarly located cells in other species, and direct  mapping to a 3-D  image of the embryo, so that the biologists can  compare gene expression  within a single embryo or across species.</p>
<p>The  data in most of the  projects Meyer collaborates on is brand new and  tools hadn’t existed for  scientists to see or interact with it.   Through computer  visualizations, the biologists were able to interact  with their data in  new ways and to more easily see patterns.  This  improved understanding  of the data helped the researchers to reassess  the direction and methods  of their experiments.  “With this tool, they  started looking at the  data and realized some of the computational work  they were doing was not  the best way to look at it.  It allowed them  to see that one of their  data sets was plagued with low levels of  noise, so they went back to  regenerated that data,” Meyer says.</p>
<p>Meyer  has another year of work  in the <a href="http://gvi.seas.harvard.edu/pfister" target="_blank">Pfister  Lab</a>, but says she  hopes to remain in Cambridge because of the  exciting opportunities in  computing, visualization, and biology in the  area.   “I get to learn  about all this cool science, then there’s a fun  design side in encoding  the data, and the geeky computer science stuff  that I love.  It’s a  wonderful mixture of a lot of different fields,”  Meyer says.</p>
<p>“Postdocs,  by nature, are a temporary thing.  They’re  a stepping-stone to the rest  of your career.  Part of me is anxious to  get started.  But on the  other hand, I have an incredible amount of  freedom right now,” Meyer  says.  “I’ve had a dream postdoc.  It’s this  really blissful period  where you get to focus on your research and  that’s it.  It’s a ton of  fun.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ivy League and Harvard University announced today that Harvard has declared an unintentional secondary violation in connection with conversations in the summer of 2007 between current assistant men’s basketball coach Kenny Blakeney and members of the Harvard coaching staff that occurred before Blakeney was employed by Harvard.</p>
<p>“Secondary violations” are by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) definition “inadvertent” and deemed to provide at most a “minimal advantage” to the institution. They are also routine for all Division I members, including Ivy League institutions; the NCAA processes more than 2,000 secondary violations annually. While Harvard and the Ivy League do not ordinarily release information related to secondary violations, they are doing so in this case in view of prior publicity in 2008, when the league released a statement that its inquiry into these matters found no violations of Ivy League or NCAA rules.</p>
<p>This revised conclusion reflects conversations between Harvard and the NCAA subsequent to Harvard’s submission of the initial report to the Ivy League on this matter and its acceptance by the Ivy League Office. The NCAA staff agreed with the league’s and Harvard’s original conclusions that at the time of the conversations Blakeney had not been offered employment and did not have an employment agreement, and that any violation was “secondary.” However, under the NCAA’s interpretation of its rules, Blakeney’s conversations with the Harvard coaching staff during a time when he was independently observing prospective student — athletes required a finding of improper recruiting assistance to Harvard. After these discussions with the NCAA, Harvard elected to acknowledge a secondary violation and to self-impose recruiting limits for the 2010-11 academic year.</p>
<p>During the Ivy League inquiry in 2008, current league Executive Director Robin Harris, while in her previous position with the Ice Miller law firm, represented a Harvard coach. Harris’ role in this case ended in September 2008, at the conclusion of the league’s initial review, before she applied for the executive director position.  She recused herself from any consideration of the NCAA matter and has not been involved in any manner in subsequent developments or decisions.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Barely a month into the world as a new Harvard College graduate, Loren Galler Rabinowitz has already skyrocketed to success as the new Miss Massachusetts.

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know the story: Harvard graduate, poised for success, becomes a doctor, lawyer, president, CEO.</p>
<p>But here’s something you don’t see every day.</p>
<p><a href="../story/2010/05/poetry-on-ice-paper/">Loren Galler Rabinowitz</a> ’10, a former English concentrator just a month out of Harvard, has been crowned <a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/brookline/features/x905157468/Brookline-native-on-way-to-Miss-America-pageant">Miss Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>Galler Rabinowitz, a former professional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Galler-Rabinowitz">figure skater</a>, poet (under the mentorship of Pulitzer Prize-winning <a href="http://www.joriegraham.com/">Jorie Graham</a>), and future medical student, said she decided to enter the <a href="http://missmassachusetts.tripod.com/">Miss Massachusetts</a> competition at the urging of Michelle Hantman, Miss Massachusetts 2000.</p>
<p>Hantman “suggested that the <a href="http://www.missamerica.org/">Miss America Organization</a> would be a good fit for me, given my commitment to academics and public service,” recalled Galler Rabinowitz, who will head to Las Vegas in January to compete for the national title. “Additionally, the scholarship opportunities available through the program are extraordinary — particularly through the Allman Scholarship, which is specifically for students accepted at or attending medical school.”</p>
<p>The Miss America Organization is the largest provider of academic scholarships to young women in the world. As Miss Massachusetts, Galler Rabinowitz received $8,000 in scholarships, and another $250 for winning the talent portion of the competition. (She is also a classically trained pianist.) The winner of the Miss America title receives a $50,000 academic scholarship.</p>
<p>“As Miss Massachusetts, I have committed my year to charity work and public service,” said Galler Rabinowitz, who as a Harvard undergrad often woke at 5 a.m. to give youth skating lessons and tutor college-bound students. “In addition to doing appearances at events across the state, I’ll also be working to promote Miss America’s national platform, the <a href="http://www.childrensmiraclenetwork.org/">Children’s Miracle Network</a>, which raises funds for the medical treatment of nearly 17 million children annually.”</p>
<p>Galler Rabinowitz, who was raised in Brookline, Mass., and in Barbados, will return to the island country where her mother runs a malnutrition center for children “to promote my personal platform, fighting childhood hunger, based on the research work I have done at my mother’s center.”</p>
<p>As part of her time in Barbados, Galler Rabinowitz, who was awarded one of the <a href="http://english.fas.harvard.edu/">English Department’s</a> Le Baron Briggs Traveling Prizes for her humanitarian work and poetry, plans on furthering her writing and working at the Barbados Nutrition Center.</p>
<p>“I’m also hoping to once again teach creative writing in a shelter for abused women and children, where I volunteered last summer.”</p>
<p>“Thinking big,” Galler Rabinowitz said, was the most important thing she learned at Harvard.</p>
<p>“This is an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use my voice to effect social change,” she said. “I’m looking forward to raising funds and awareness for children in need and talking to students across the state about what it means to be successful. To me, it’s getting to do something you’re passionate about every single day, and making the world around you a better place in the process.”</p>

]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bring the brains and the bucks together.</p>
<p>That was the pragmatic goal behind “Venture Summit East 2010,” a conference held June 21 to 23 at <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/">Harvard Business School</a> (HBS). Institutional investors, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, investment bankers, and research analysts gathered to explore economic, political, and technological trends in global investment.</p>
<p>In one panel, venture capitalists and CEOs explored the sometimes delicate dynamic between the two powerhouse economic fields. They asked: How can investors and inventors best work together to get smart ideas off the ground and into the public realm?</p>
<p>Egos and attitudes play an important role, the panelists said, along with the ability to admit strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>“Too often, I think entrepreneurs and venture capitalists get stuck in a cycle of dysfunction … to promote their own egos or cover up their weaknesses,” said panelist Andy Palmer, former CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.vertica.com/">Vertica Systems</a>, which produces analytic database management systems. “The most successful companies are the ones that strip away all of that and focus on the transparency.”</p>
<p>During a panel called “Can VCs and Entrepreneurs Solve the World&#8217;s<br />
Problems?” <a href="http://www.greylock.com/">Greylock Partners</a> chairman <a href="http://www.greylock.com/team/team/7/">Henry McCance</a> described his work to bring a venture capital mindset to medical research by founding the <a href="http://www.curealzfund.org/">Cure Alzheimer’s Fund</a>. Eliminating the typical lengthy research grant process and building an all-star team, he said, sped up discovery. In less than three years, said McCance, the fund’s researchers identified about 70 gene variants that confer risk or help to protect against Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Consider venture philanthropy early in a career, he urged. McCance predicted that a venture capitalist approach will crack the next generation of global problems in health care, energy, and education.</p>
<p>In a keynote address, <a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=ovr&amp;facId=6544">Bill Sahlman</a>, the Dimitri V. D’Arbeloff-MBA Class of 1955 Professor of Business Administration and senior associate dean for external relations, explored the high risk and reward aspects of venture capital. He examined a chart detailing 636 venture capital investments from 1995 to 2009 and noted that 62 percent of the $1.2 billion invested during that period was “flush, gone, zero, nada.”</p>
<p>In the same time frame, just over 3 percent of the dollars invested turned into 53 percent of the “ultimate value of the portfolio,” he said.</p>
<p>Sahlman’s chart reflected an inherent venture capital conundrum: Profits are the goal, but more often than not investments fail to produce hefty returns. But regardless of the bottom line, he argued, such investment is critical in spurring important innovation in areas such as life and material sciences and alternative fuels.</p>
<p>“Venture capital’s losses,” said Sahlman, “are society’s gains.”</p>
<p>The event, co-sponsored by HBS and <a href="http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/Pages/default.aspx">KPMG</a>, a global network of professional firms providing audit, tax, and advisory services, examined a range of topics, including expanding investment opportunities in digital media, identifying the keys to strong management teams, developing mobile technology and biofuels, and understanding the impact of globalization.</p>
<p>A panel of health care investment executives and entrepreneurs said technology will play an increasingly important role in streamlining industry processes, including collecting patient data.</p>
<p>Doctors “feel like they are data input clerks,” said Rob Cosinuke, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth Inc.</a>, a company that has created a Web-based application to assist practice management, billing services, and medical records management. “If you can come up with applications that take doctors out of being keystroke monkeys and into being doctors again, the small group and the group practices are going to buy it like crazy.”</p>
<p>Another panelist said one health care avenue worthy of investment has nothing to do with medical care and everything to do with lifestyle changes. “I would encourage everybody to blow up the paradigm in their minds that health care is only about hospitals and doctors,” said <a href="http://www.chrysalisventures.com/team/david-jones/">David Jones Jr.</a>, managing director of the venture capital firm <a href="http://www.chrysalisventures.com/">Chrysalis Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Jones said his company has invested heavily in trends that deliver “incentives, information, and monitoring” services and “all kinds of things to do with health but not medical care.”</p>
<p>The life sciences are another field attracting attention and funding, according to a panel of investors and entrepreneurs. Despite the slowly rebounding economy, they said, there is money available for that sector.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of opportunities for the right ideas to get funded,” said <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com/ourteam/bio.cfm?id=45">Peter Barrett</a> from <a href="http://www.atlasventure.com/">Atlas Venture</a>. The firm’s portfolio includes a significant number of life sciences businesses in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>The mix of inventors and investors detailed what they consider some of the most promising areas in the field. One was the use of biotechnology to increase the production and capacity of coal-bed methane wells.</p>
<p>Another was a biological breakthrough by biologist Craig Venter and his biotechnology company <a href="http://www.syntheticgenomics.com/">Synthetic Genomics</a>. <a href="http://www.emven.com/investment.html">Juan Enriquez</a>, managing director of <a href="http://www.emven.com/index.html">Excel Venture Management</a>, which backs Venter’s firm, described how the company works to combine computer code, robots, and the largest organic molecule humans have ever built. Enriquez admitted it was not creating “life from scratch.” But he called it “the equivalent of walking down to your Volkswagen with a Lexus engine, sticking your Lexus engine into the Volkswagen and having every part of that car become a Lexus by the next morning. … That will be something that will have an impact across a whole series of different industries.”</p>
<p>Panel moderator Robert Noonan, a partner at KPMG, summed up, saying, “There’s a lot of exciting tech still out there, a lot of good ideas that deserve funding, and a lot of hope for the future.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at <a href="http://harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> and the <a href="http://mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> are learning to reshape the landscape of programmable matter by devising self-folding sheets that rely on the ancient art of origami.<br />
The research team demonstrated how a single thin sheet composed of interconnected triangular sections could transform itself into a boat or plane shape — without the help of skilled fingers. The findings were published in the online <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/recent">Early Edition</a> of the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> (PNAS) on Monday (June 28).</p>
<p>The lead authors are <a href="http://micro.seas.harvard.edu/">Robert Wood</a>, associate professor of electrical engineering at the Harvard <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> (SEAS) and a core faculty member of the <a href="http://wyss.harvard.edu/">Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</a>, and <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rus/">Daniela Rus</a>, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at MIT and co-director of the <a href="http://robotics.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL Center for Robotics</a>. Using a concept called programmable matter by folding, the researchers envision creating “smart” cups that could adjust based upon the amount of liquid needed, or even a “Swiss army knife” that could form into tools ranging from wrenches to tripods.</p>
<p>“The process begins when we first create an algorithm for folding,” said Wood. “Similar to a set of instructions in an origami book, we determine, based upon the desired end shapes, where to crease the sheet.”</p>
<p>The sheet, a thin composite of rigid tiles and elastomer joints (with elastic polymers), is studded with thin foil actuators (motorized switches) and flexible electronics. The demonstration material contains 25 actuators, divided into five groupings. A shape is produced by triggering the proper actuator groups in sequence.</p>
<p>To initiate the on-demand folding, the team devised a series of stickers, thin materials that contain the circuitry able to prompt the actuators to make the folds. This can be done without a user having to access a computer, reducing “programming” to merely placing the stickers in the appropriate places. When the sheet receives the proper jolt of current, it begins to fold, staying in place thanks to magnetic closures.</p>
<p>“Smart sheets are origami robots that will make any shape on demand for their user,” said Rus. “A big achievement was discovering the theoretical foundations and universality of folding and fold planning, which provide the brain and the decision-making system for the smart sheet.”</p>
<p>The fancy folding techniques were inspired in part by the work of co-author <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/">Erik Demaine</a>, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, and one of the world’s most recognized experts on computational origami.</p>
<p>While the Harvard and MIT engineers only demonstrated two simple shapes, the proof of concept holds promise. The long-term aim is to make programmable matter more robust and practical, leading to materials that can perform multiple tasks, for instance, an entire dining utensil set derived from one piece of foldable material.</p>
<p>“The shape-shifting sheets demonstrate an end-to-end process that is a first step toward making everyday objects whose mechanical properties can be programmed,” said Wood.</p>
<p>Wood and Rus’ co-authors include Elliot Hawkes and Hiroto Tanaka, both at Harvard, and Byoung Kwon An, Nadia Benbernou, Sangbae Kim, and Erik Demaine, all at MIT.</p>
<p>The research received funding from the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (DARPA).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“You can feel the energy in the room,” said <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/09.16/01-academy.html">Maxine Rodburg</a>, director of the <a href="http://www.crimsonsummer.harvard.edu/">Crimson Summer Academy</a> (CSA), as she raised her voice to be heard above the din of students talking and laughing amid yellow streamers and blue balloons that read “Welcome Back!”</p>
<p>“There’s always been this amazing sense of camaraderie and a true sense of warmth among our scholars,” Rodburg said. “You can see it again tonight.”</p>
<p>About 100 current and former CSA scholars gathered Wednesday (June 23) in Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge for a reunion barbecue, reveling in a rare chance to catch up with fellow scholars and meet new ones.</p>
<p>Founded in 2004 as part of an initiative to improve access to college for talented, economically disadvantaged students in the Boston and Cambridge areas, CSA brings them to campus for three consecutive summers in a rigorous academic program. With the inaugural class of scholars having finished their junior year in college, the lasting impact of the program is just now becoming evident.</p>
<p>“It’s really exciting,” said Juliana Santoyo, a member of the first CSA class, who is now a rising senior at Boston College, studying English and philosophy. “I’m so happy to see it succeeding.”</p>
<p>Sitting at a table with other members of that original class, Santoyo and her colleagues sat chatting and joking as if it had been only yesterday since they’d seen each other, and not three years. One student had just returned from her junior year abroad in South Africa. Another was just back from Australia.</p>
<p>“I feel old,” joked Jefferson Correia, as he surveyed the room of scholars who have followed since he graduated from CSA in 2007. Now studying accounting at Syracuse University and back from a semester in Hong Kong, Correia rejoiced in how far he has come since applying to CSA seven years ago.</p>
<p>“Never in my life would I have expected I’d be doing stuff like that,” he said. “I see kids I went to middle school with, and they never left [Cambridge]. I feel like a lot of that stems from the confidence CSA gave me, to know that I could go away and succeed.”</p>
<p>Laura Ospina, a Cambridge resident and now a junior at Tufts, agreed. Her dream was to study abroad, and there she was, freshly returned from a year of study in Spain.</p>
<p>“They [CSA] really made it all attainable … they gave me the backup I needed to achieve my dreams,” said Ospina, who is working as a CSA mentor this summer.</p>
<p>Across the room, Rodburg threw her arms around Marjorie Lopez Marinez, a sophomore at Georgetown University, who walked in from her summer job smartly dressed in pearls and heels. A native of Boston’s Mission Hill neighborhood, Lopez Marinez is interning this summer at Sen. John Kerry’s office in Boston and will continue interning in Washington, D.C., this fall, working around her school schedule.</p>
<p>The event was an opportunity to reflect on the dozens of success stories in the room. Harvard grad Roxanna “Roxie” Myhrum &#8217;05, who mentored students during CSA’s first year, emphasized the program’s success as a whole.</p>
<p>“Doing anything for the first time is hard, but doing something like CSA with this level of ambition was amazing to be a part of. It really inspired all of us to give all we had to the program,” said Myhrum.</p>
<p>CSA scholars live on campus and attend classes for five to seven weeks. They receive financial support in the form of laptops, stipends to replace lost summer earnings, and $3,000 scholarships to the colleges of their choice on completion. In addition, they are given year-round mentoring and guidance on academics and in selecting and applying to colleges, something that many can’t get at home. To date, all Crimson Scholar graduates have been accepted to four-year universities.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t done CSA, I would have had a lot of misconceptions about college,” said Tobias Estime, who graduated from Cambridge Rindge &amp; Latin in 2009. “I probably wouldn’t have really considered going to college.”</p>
<p>Estime is back at CSA for the summer working as a mentor. He just finished his first year at Harvard.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Researchers, led by Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Shiladitya Sengupta, have devised a way to improve a low-cost, effective cancer drug, cisplatin, whose use has been limited by its toxicity.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harvard and <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/">Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a> researchers have devised a method that may allow clinicians to use higher doses of a powerful chemotherapy drug that has been limited because it is toxic not only to tumors but to patients’ kidneys.</p>
<p>The research, conducted in laboratory animals, marries chemistry and nanotechnology to deliver toxic platinum atoms to tumors while almost entirely blocking the platinum from accumulating in the kidney, according to <a href="http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/membership/profile/member/1594/0/">Shiladitya Sengupta</a>, a Harvard assistant professor of medicine and health sciences and technology whose Laboratory for Nanomedicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital conducted the work.</p>
<p>Sengupta has focused his research for three years on cisplatin, a powerful anti-cancer drug used in first-line chemotherapy. Sengupta said the drug, discovered about 40 years ago, has many positive aspects. It is relatively inexpensive and effective against many cancers. Its toxicity, however, limits its use.</p>
<p>“Even if you can see amazing results as an anti-tumor therapy, you can’t give more,” Sengupta said.</p>
<p>Despite several attempts, cisplatin hasn’t been improved upon, Sengupta said. Two similar drugs that also incorporate platinum are on the market, but while they are less toxic to the kidney, they are also less active against tumors.</p>
<p>Though the chemistry involved is complex, the key to cisplatin’s effectiveness — and its toxicity — lies in how easily it releases platinum, both at the tumor site and, undesirably, in the kidneys.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of the two alternative drugs have reduced those drugs’ toxicity by making them hold onto their platinum more tightly. Sengupta’s work took a different track, however. Understanding that particles greater than five nanometers in size would not be absorbed by the kidney, he set out to engineer a super-sized cisplatin.</p>
<p>Understanding the chemical properties of the cisplatin molecule and the laws that govern molecular folding, his team designed a polymer that would bind to cisplatin, much as a thread runs through a bead’s central hole. By stringing together enough cisplatin, the whole molecule wrapped itself into a ball, 100 nanometers in size, too large to enter the kidney.</p>
<p>It took a couple of tries to get the molecular design right, Sengupta said. Though the initial design proved nontoxic to kidneys, it wasn’t as effective as the original cisplatin. Sengupta and colleagues tweaked the chemical formula so the molecule didn’t hold quite so tightly to the platinum atoms.</p>
<p>Studies conducted by Basar Bilgicer, assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame, showed that the molecule accumulated in tumor tissue, whose leaky blood vessels allowed it to pass out of the capillaries that feed the tumor. The molecule is too large to pass into other tissues, such as the kidney, lungs, liver, and spleen. Once lodged in the tumor, the higher acidity there caused the molecule to fall apart, dumping its toxic load on the cancerous tissue.</p>
<p>“It showed absolutely minimal toxicity to the kidney,” Sengupta said.</p>
<p>The new compound has been found to be effective against lung and breast cancers. Instructor in pathology <a href="http://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/membership/profile/member/177/0/">Daniela Dinulescu </a>at Brigham and Women’s Hospital also demonstrated that the nano-compound outperformed cisplatin in a transgenic ovarian cancer model that mimics the disease in humans.</p>
<p>The research, which received funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department’s Breast Cancer Research Program, has not been tried in humans, and would require potentially lengthy testing before being ready for patient care.</p>
<p>Described in this week’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the project also included researchers at the University of Notre Dame, the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, India, and the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Sengupta praised the work and creativity of fellows Abhimanyu Paraskar and Shivani Soni on the project.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers probing the secrets of HIV and AIDS gathered at <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a> Wednesday (June 23) to share information about the latest advances in understanding how the oldest part of the body’s immune system might help in the fight against HIV.</p>
<p>The human immune system, which fights off bacteria, viruses, and other invaders to keep people healthy, has two major branches. The “adaptive” immune system evolved most recently and is made up of components such as antibodies, B-cells, and T-cells. It is the part of the immune system that “remembers” a first-time invader, such as chicken pox, and mounts an immune response the next time the virus enters the body.</p>
<p>The “innate” immune system is much older and is shared with a wide range of species, including plants, insects, and fungi. When an invader is recognized, that system mounts a general attack that includes, among its many responses, inflammation, mobilization of white blood cells to engulf invaders, and natural killer cells to attack infected host cells.</p>
<p>Event organizer <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/virology/fac/Barouch.html">Dan Barouch</a>, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of the Division of Vaccine Research at Harvard-affiliated<a href="http://www.bidmc.org/"> Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, </a>said recent advances in understanding innate immunity made this a good subject for this year’s scientific symposium, hosted by <a href="http://cfar.globalhealth.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">Harvard’s Center for AIDS Research </a>(CFAR). The session was attended by scientists ranging from students to junior researchers to senior faculty members.</p>
<p>The event was designed for scientists to exchange information and to spark new thinking and collaborations among researchers whose work might prove complementary.</p>
<p>“One of the principal goals of the Harvard CFAR is to bring researchers together, either within a discipline, or, more importantly, across disciplines,” Barouch said. “Innate immunity is a good example of that because it really brings together people interested in vaccine work, pathogenesis, basic virology,” he said, “and the clinical aspects of innate immunity are of interest to clinicians and a wide variety of people in different fields. The hope is that these sessions today will help bring investigators together from different disciplines across the Harvard CFAR and will stimulate further collaborations and synergy.”</p>
<p>The researchers came from Harvard, affiliated hospitals, the National Cancer Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The attendees discussed technical topics, including cooperation between innate and acquired immune response genes, using systems biology to help design a vaccine, and the recruitment of natural killer cells in attacking HIV.</p>
<p>Galit Alter, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at the <a href="http://www.ragoninstitute.org/index.html">Ragon Institute </a>of MGH, MIT and Harvard, spoke about the role that antibodies from the adaptive immune system play in recruiting a potentially effective response against HIV from the innate immune system’s natural killer cells.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Groups band together to create a “green street” in Allston that embraces sustainable landscaping.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 2,500-square-foot swath of cracked pavement and rusty fencing along Everett Street at the <a href="http://www.gisbos.org/">German International School of Boston</a> has given way to the first public “green street” in Allston.</p>
<p>The project uses sustainable landscaping, including seven new trees, a rain garden, and permeable pavement to help collect and treat stormwater before it can carry pollutants into the nearby Charles River. It also has benches as well as planter and sidewalk art made by children from the German School.</p>
<p>At the project’s dedication on Monday (June 21), Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino applauded the “multifaceted partnership” that helped to make the new open space a reality. He addressed a crowd of neighbors, representatives from the city and community organizations, local green-space advocates, and staff from the German School, St. Anthony’s Parish, Harvard University, and Boston College.</p>
<p>“This is another example of how, working together, we can make this city environmentally better,” said Menino. “Boston is the third-greenest city in America because of people like you stepping up to the plate.”</p>
<p>The Everett Street project, led by the <a href="http://www.allstonbrightoncdc.org/">Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation</a> and the <a href="http://www.crwa.org/">Charles River Watershed Association</a> in collaboration with the local community, received a $25,000 Harvard Allston Partnership Fund grant. It also was funded by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation Urban Forestry Fund, and the Boston College Neighborhood Fund.</p>
<p>The project underscores that the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation and the Charles River Watershed Association, like Harvard, are interested in enhancing community vitality and greening. Harvard’s efforts in Allston include the creation of new sustainable open spaces such as the planned park behind the Honan Branch Library that will utilize similar stormwater management strategies; installation of new “learning gardens” this summer at the corner of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street; and an infiltration planter on Hague Street, where the treatment of roadway runoff is being assessed.</p>
<p>Harvard has provided $200,000 in Harvard Allston Partnership Fund grants to date, assisting 14 community organizations in beautifying the neighborhood, expanding existing community programs, and broadening access to those programs through community-based scholarships.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School’s</a> Institute of Politics (IOP) selected an experienced group of individuals for resident fellowships this fall. The announcement was made June 24.</p>
<p>The resident fellows include <strong>Dennis Archer</strong>, mayor, Detroit, Mich. (1994-2001), president, National League of Cities (2000-01), and president, American Bar Association (2003-04); <strong>Susan Milligan</strong>, national political reporter, The Boston Globe; <strong>Michèle Pierre-Louis</strong>, prime minister of Haiti (2008-09); <strong>Ophir Pines-Paz</strong>, Israel’s minister of interior (2005), minister of science, culture, and sport (2006), and Knesset member (1996-2010); <strong>Margaret Spellings</strong>, U.S. secretary of education (2005-09); and <strong>John Timoney</strong>, former Miami, Fla., chief of police, Philadelphia, Pa., police commissioner, and New York City first deputy commissioner.</p>
<p>“Inspiring interactions with top public sector leaders is a key reason student engagement in the field continues to grow,” said IOP Director Bill Purcell. “This fellows class is an ideal group of leaders who can help turn interest in public service into a career and commitment to making a difference.”</p>
<p>Over the course of an academic semester, resident fellows interact with students, participate in the intellectual life of the Harvard community, and lead weekly study groups on a range of topics.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Researchers find ways in which tactile sensations appear to influence social judgments and decisions in everyday life.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychologists report in the journal Science that interpersonal interactions can be shaped, profoundly yet unconsciously, by the physical attributes of incidental objects: Resumes reviewed on a heavy clipboard are judged to be more substantive, while a negotiator seated in a soft chair is less likely to drive a hard bargain.</p>
<p>The research was conducted by psychologists at <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University,</a> t<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">he Massachusetts Institute of Technology, </a>and <a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale University.</a> The authors say the work suggests that physical touch — the first of our senses to develop — may continue to operate throughout life like a scaffold upon which people build their social judgments and decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Touch remains perhaps the most underappreciated sense in behavioral research,&#8221; said co-author Christopher C. Nocera, a graduate student in Harvard&#8217;s Department of Psychology. &#8220;Our work suggests that greetings involving touch, such as handshakes and cheek kisses, may in fact have critical influences on our social interactions, in an unconscious fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nocera conducted the research with Joshua M. Ackerman, assistant professor of marketing at MIT&#8217;s <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/">Sloan School of Management,</a> and John A. Bargh, professor of psychology at Yale.</p>
<p>&#8220;First impressions are liable to be influenced by the tactile environment, and control over this environment may be especially important for negotiators, pollsters, job seekers, and others interested in interpersonal communication,&#8221; the authors wrote in the latest issue of Science. &#8220;The use of &#8216;tactile tactics&#8217; may represent a new frontier in social influence and communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers conducted a series of experiments probing how objects&#8217; weight, texture, and hardness can unconsciously influence judgments about unrelated events and situations:</p>
<p>— To test the effects of weight, metaphorically associated with seriousness and importance, subjects used either light or heavy clipboards while evaluating resumes. They judged candidates whose resumes were seen on a heavy clipboard as better qualified and more serious about the position, and rated their own accuracy at the task as more important.</p>
<p>— An experiment testing texture&#8217;s effects had participants arrange rough or smooth puzzle pieces before hearing a story about a social interaction. Those who worked with the rough puzzle were likelier to describe the interaction in the story as uncoordinated and harsh.</p>
<p>— In a test of hardness, subjects handled either a soft blanket or a hard wooden block before being told an ambiguous story about a workplace interaction between a supervisor and an employee. Those who touched the block judged the employee as more rigid and strict.</p>
<p>— A second hardness experiment showed that even passive touch can shape interactions. Subjects seated in hard or soft chairs engaged in mock haggling over the price of a new car. Subjects in hard chairs were less</p>
<p>flexible, showing less movement between successive offers. They also judged their adversaries in the negotiations as more stable and less emotional.</p>
<p>Nocera and his colleagues say these experiments suggest that information acquired through touch exerts broad, if generally imperceptible, influence over cognition. They propose that encounters with objects can elicit a &#8220;haptic mindset,&#8221; triggering application of associated concepts even to unrelated people and situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;People often assume that exploration of new things occurs primarily through the eyes,&#8221; Nocera said. &#8220;While the informative power of vision is irrefutable, this is not the whole story. For example, the typical reaction to an unknown object is usually as follows: With an outstretched arm and an open hand, we ask, &#8216;Can I see that?&#8217; This</p>
<p>response suggests the investigation is not limited to vision, but rather the integrative sum of seeing, feeling, touching, and manipulating the unfamiliar object.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nocera said that because touch appears to be the first sense that people use to experience the world ╤ for example, by equating the warm and gentle touch of a mother with comfort and safety ╤ it may provide part of</p>
<p>the basis by which metaphorical abstraction allows for the development of a more complex understanding of comfort and safety. This physical-to-mental abstraction is reflected in metaphors and shared linguistic descriptors, such as the multiple meanings of words like &#8220;hard,&#8221; &#8220;rough,&#8221; and &#8220;heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nocera, Ackerman, and Bargh&#8217;s work was supported by the Sloan School of Management at MIT and by <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml">the National Institute of Mental Health.</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[At a Harvard “lawn swap,” everything was free, including a lesson on the environmental advantages of reusing office supplies and other goods.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you trying to hold back disaster on a warming planet? Small, personal steps — measured collectively — can have great meaning. That’s why Harvard sustainability officials have a message for you: Swap rather than shop.</p>
<p>The lesson was free on Monday (June 21) at a University-wide “lawn swap” under a big tent in front of the Science Center. The operative idea was “freecycling,” the exchange of reusable goods at no cost. The “seller” gives something away, and the “buyer” takes something away. For free.</p>
<p>“So many people came over thinking it was a yard sale,” and were surprised that no cash was involved, said co-organizer Gosia Sklodowska of Harvard’s <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/">Office for Sustainability</a> (OFS). “They had to triple-check with us.”</p>
<p>Sklodowska, who manages the greenhouse gas reduction program at the <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/">Faculty of Arts and Sciences</a> (FAS), stood under the big open-sided tent, where sweet breezes and welcome shade were free too. Nearby was the Farmers’ Market at Harvard, open Tuesdays in Cambridge, with its celebration of local goods. “We wanted to keep the same spirit,” she said of the local giveaway.</p>
<p>Co-sponsors of the swap included OFS, the <a href="http://green.harvard.edu/fas/green-program">FAS Green Program</a>, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Law School</a> (HLS), Harvard <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> (SEAS), and Harvard <a href="http://www.uos.harvard.edu/">University Operations Services</a>, which oversees campus recycling and a redistribution program for used furniture every Thursday. The <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/">Harvard Extension School</a> donated use of the tent.</p>
<p>Harvard staff members — those with extra supplies or those needing them — were the swap’s target audience. But anyone was invited to give and take, for home or office. Tables held file folders, printers, books, lamps, music CDs, art supplies, clothes, sports equipment, and more.</p>
<p>Only one prohibition applied: No computers, televisions, large electronics, or furniture, things that could have other destinations. For those big items, organizers suggested Craigslist, the <a href="http://www.green.harvard.edu/reuselist">Harvard ReuseList</a>, <a href="http://harvie.harvard.edu/harvieslist/">Harvie’s List classifieds</a>, or the Law School’s <a href="mailto:HLSFreecycle@lists.law.harvard.edu">HLSFreecycle@lists.law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>
<p>There are environmental benefits to swapping reusable goods “on many fronts,” said Sklodowska. It reduces waste so that unwanted stuff doesn’t wind up in the trash. Freecycling also eliminates the environmental costs of making new products, including the fossil fuels needed to extract raw materials, manufacture goods, and transport them.</p>
<p>“I hope when people come to events like this they think of reuse as a first option, instead of buying new,” said Cara Ferrentino ’08, who has a degree in environmental science and public policy and oversees HLS sustainability programs. “It’s one part of a change in mindsets we’re trying to make in general.”</p>
<p>Monday’s 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. swap peaked early and surpassed expectations. “It took off,” said Sklodowska. “People were so strongly into it.” Those dropping things off, starting at 9 a.m., ended up taking things away early. By noon, the long arrays of tables were nearly picked clean.</p>
<p>If you rushed, you could still get a book on nematode anatomy, a French grammar review, or a tattered guide to bridge tournaments. (But even the pile of books remaining made an opening for conversation. One began, “Bertrand Russell said …” an opening that occasioned a general retreat to the office supplies table.)</p>
<p>One undergraduate wheeled her bicycle along the aisles. “I should have come earlier,” she said, picking through a box of handsome note cards donated by Lamont Library. “All I wanted was a dish rack.”</p>
<p>The dish racks were gone, though — along with a list of goods that an OFS intern had earlier catalogued: nearly 400 books, 25 pairs of women’s shoes, four scanners, nine 500-piece boxes of envelopes, two coffee makers, one hand-sewn quilt, and one baby walker.</p>
<p>The list included 20 vintage VHS tapes. Kate Zirpolo-Flynn, an SEAS staffer who won a Green Carpet award earlier this year, slipped one of the few left into her bag. It was “Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,” a 1994 film about wit and writer Dorothy Parker. “It’s my husband’s favorite movie,” she said.</p>
<p>Sklodowska, who is pregnant and due in October, picked up a few baby toys. “They will come in handy a few months from now.”</p>
<p>Ferrentino was determined to leave empty-handed. With a touch of pride, she said, “I brought things.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three quarters of the seven million jobs that have vanished in the recession belonged to men. The male unemployment rate is now 9.8 percent, vs. 8.1 percent for women. The trend got Larry Summers, the president&#8217;s top economic adviser, speculating recently, &#8220;When the economy recovers five years from now, one in six men who are 25 to 54 will not be working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ouch. While the decline in construction and manufacturing is hurting men in the workforce, expansion of health care and education is helping women. It also helps women that we are traditionally paid less (earning 22% less than men, on average). It&#8217;s usually more profitable to keep a woman on the payroll than a man. &#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This time, the Radcliffe art show at Byerly Hall is by staff members, and will be on display through the summer.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Staff members from the <a href="http://www.radcliffe.edu/default.aspx">Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study </a>gathered in the Byerly Hall art gallery on June 15 to view something familiar: photographs, acrylic paintings, pencil sketches, and chromogenic color prints decorating the walls.</p>
<p>Deans and development officers mingled with manuscript cataloguers while nibbling pastries. The Latin-flavored stylings of the Di eVano String Quartet brought a taste of spice to the festivities.</p>
<p>This time, though, something was different. The artwork surrounding the chattering crowd wasn’t produced by an institute fellow (like sculptor/photographer <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/02/sculptural-photos/">Leslie Hewitt</a>, RI ’10, whose show appeared in Byerly in February, or filmmaker <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/05/palestinians-on-the-screen/">Kamal Aljafari</a>, RI ’10, whose movie stills graced the walls in May). Rather, the prints, paintings, ceramics, and architectural models were created by the staff members.</p>
<p>Radcliffe human resources generalist Myra Garza organized the show, along with seven colleagues. “The idea stemmed from various staff members with different ideas but the same objective: to celebrate the artists among us,” she said. She and her team sent out a call for artists in mid-May and then began to plan the show and soiree.</p>
<p>The Radcliffe community’s response was remarkable. Bill Bebout, who has worked in the mailroom for more than 30 years, brought five original paintings — and a mobile made of foam core and music wire. Susan Landry, a<a href="http://www.radcliffe.edu/schlesinger_library.aspx"> Schlesinger Library</a> administrative assistant, contributed several watercolor pieces and three hand-cut block print tablecloths. Debra Smith, a staff assistant in the educational programs department, signed up to read three of her poems.</p>
<p>Among the 19 artists who answered the call was graphic designer and production coordinator Jessica Brilli, whose exhibition of oil paintings “Before 30” appeared in the Holyoke Center in the summer of 2007. “I always knew how talented my Radcliffe colleagues were, and this show absolutely confirms that,” she said. “I feel honored to display my work with them.”</p>
<p>The exhibition continues at 8 Garden St. in Radcliffe Yard through the summer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Glenn Laboratories hosted the annual symposium on aging, reviewing new developments in understanding the mechanisms of growing old.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the technical talk about sirtuins, resveratrol, and stem cells at <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS) on Monday (June 21), a nontechnical message became clear: Progress is slowly being made in understanding why people age and in laying the foundation to lessen the debilitating diseases of aging.</p>
<p>Progress is important. HMS Dean <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/public/news/new-dean.html">Jeffrey Flier</a> pointed out that the U.S. population is graying rapidly, meaning that people are not just living longer but are spending more time dealing with the ailments and conditions that often accompany aging, such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>“People are living longer, but with that also comes the burden of disability, chronic disease, and [increased] cost,” Flier said. “We are in the midst of a very exciting period of basic aging research.”</p>
<p>Flier introduced an all-day scientific symposium on aging sponsored by the Medical School’s <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/agingresearch/">Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging</a>. The symposium, held at the New Research Building, featured researchers addressing technical topics related to aging, including the roles of cellular power plants called mitochondria; aging in animal models such as the roundworm <em>C. elegans</em>; and the role of the human autophagy system, which regulates the destruction of molecules and structures inside the cell.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/fac/yankner.html">Bruce Yankner</a>, co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Labs and professor of pathology and neurology at HMS, said the symposium was intended as a forum for scientists to share recent results in hope of not only spreading information but also of fostering collaboration among researchers who might not otherwise meet.</p>
<p>Among the presenters Monday was <a href="http://web.mit.edu/picower/faculty/tsai.html">Li-Huei Tsai</a>, director of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/picower/index.html">Picower Institute for Learning and Memory</a> at the <a href="http://mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. Tsai’s lab is investigating whether cognitive function can be restored after memory loss. In experiments with lab mice, research has shown that it can. Tsai and colleagues are investigating mechanisms through which this might happen, zeroing in on specific molecules that might be implicated in memory formation and cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Resveratrol, the compound hailed in red wine as an anti-aging agent, has been shown to have positive effects on learning and memory in laboratory animals, Tsai said, reducing loss of neurons and learning impairment.</p>
<p>“Resveratrol is actually even better than you think,” Tsai said.</p>
<p>Glenn, the donor behind the Glenn Labs’ creation, said he believes that the mechanisms of aging are mainly regulated by molecular biology, and therefore can be understood and possibly affected by scientists. Glenn, a <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Law School</a> graduate who left the practice of law for investment banking, created a foundation to fund medical research into aging in 1965, when few people were paying attention to the field. Glenn said he became interested in the field in the ’50s after seeing his great-grandmother and then both his grandparents succumb to the symptoms of aging.</p>
<p>A lot of progress has been made, Glenn said, but much work remains.</p>
<p>“The mysteries are still there, but we’re getting closer,” Glenn said. “We don’t know what the ceiling is on the [human] lifespan — it’s going to get longer because it is a problem of molecular biology.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dean Mohsen Mostafavi of the <a href="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu">Graduate School of Design</a> (GSD) and Dean David T. Ellwood of the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a><em> </em>(HKS)<em> </em>have announced the appointment of <a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/people/eric_belsky.html">Eric S. Belsky</a> as managing director of Harvard’s <a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu">Joint Center for Housing Studies</a>, effective July 1. Belsky is a nationally recognized scholar with great depth of experience in housing research, teaching, and public policy.</p>
<p>“Eric’s expertise in shaping a rigorous research agenda that is widely accessible to policymakers and practitioners will foster the Center’s ability to advance knowledge and inform public dialogue on the importance of housing in the context of 21st century challenges including urbanism, globalism, sustainability, and affordability,” said Mostafavi.</p>
<p>Belsky has served as executive director of the Joint Center for 12 years, and has held teaching appointments in urban design and public policy at the GSD and HKS. Belsky’s research and writing has focused on housing markets, finance, and policy. He has published numerous articles in trade publications and academic journals, and has co-edited four books. He received his B.A., master’s degree, and Ph.D. from Clark University.</p>
<p>“Eric’s experience working with a broad cross-section of public and private-sector leaders will be a valuable asset to the Center and its constituents, both here at Harvard and externally, where research and policy meet public debate and practice,” said Ellwood.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Harvard opens mini-golf course, batting cages for the Allston community.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The former Volkswagen dealership and garage took on a decidedly sporty look Friday (June 18) as the Harvard Allston Field and Fairway officially opened beneath a warm, bright sun.</p>
<p>The scene outside 168 Western Ave. was a real-life reflection of the putting and batting paintings displayed on the former car showroom’s windows. Last winter, the space was turned into a community ice skating rink, and now it will be used as an urban batting and mini-golf facility that will be open through the summer and fall as the University seeks a long-term tenant.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 area residents came to help kick off the first of many fun weekends at the site, which is open to the public Fridays through Sundays.</p>
<p>For lifelong Allston resident Anwar Ahmedi and his 2-year-old daughter, Yari Burgos, it was an easy trip. He crossed the street from his home at the Charlesview Apartments.</p>
<p>“You know, you can walk to a park in Allston, but you can’t walk to a mini-golf course,” said Ahmedi. “This is great.”</p>
<p>Within 30 minutes of the opening, dozens of golfers were out on the “green,” a 100-by-120-foot freshly painted, paved area for the new 18-hole mini-golf course. At the same time, a few future big leaguers were swinging for the imaginary fences at two indoor batting cages. In the game room, Harvard officials held a raffle, and residents enjoyed cool air as well as fresh fruit from the nearby Harvard Allston Farmers’ Market that opened for the season the same day.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see families enjoying this space together,” said Executive Vice President <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/08/katherine-n-lapp-named-harvard-executive-vice-president/">Katie Lapp,</a> who oversees the departments that installed the facility. The space is part of Harvard’s ongoing commitment to strengthen the active stewardship of its properties and enhance community vitality in Allston.</p>
<p>Ed Kotomori, another Allston resident, said the opening brought a new facet to the Harvard-Allston relationship.</p>
<p>“Programs like this bring the neighborhood and the University together. This type of activity — coupled with the education portal and other community programs — you can’t ask for a better relationship,” said Kotomori. He said he saw entire families, from grandparents to parents and their children, at the opening. He said the facility will be a great destination for children this summer, “to keep them safe and off the streets.”</p>
<p>The facility will be open on the following schedule: Fridays from 3 to 8 p.m.; Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nature writer Sy Montgomery talked about her hunt for the dangerous cassowary, as well as her passion for nature, during a presentation at the Harvard Museum of Natural History.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An adult <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-cassowary.html">cassowary</a> is considered the world’s most dangerous bird. It can weigh 150 pounds, run 30 miles per hour, and attack with a sharp, 5-inch claw on each foot. To author<a href="http://www.authorwire.com/s/birdology.html"> Sy Montgomery</a>, the flightless cassowary hearkens back to distant dinosaur ancestors, bearing a velociraptor’s claw and a hadrosaur’s bony crest.</p>
<p>Just the kind of creature Montgomery wanted to meet.</p>
<p>Montgomery tracked the cassowary through Australia’s leech-laden forests for days, finally coming face to face with one at the last possible hour, after she put time provided by a bus delay to good use and made one last forest visit.</p>
<p>As she sat at the edge of the woods, contemplating her impending failure to see a cassowary in the wild, one came into view. The bird walked among the nearby trees, ignoring her, though Montgomery was sure it knew she was there. She could see it clearly, its blue head, swaying red wattles, its dark feathers … and those claws.</p>
<p>“It was like it stepped out of a crack in time,” Montgomery said. “You look at a cassowary, and you know you’re in the presence of a living dinosaur.”</p>
<p>Montgomery described the search for the cassowary, along with her other bird-centered adventures, Thursday (June 17) to an audience at the <a href="http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/">Harvard Museum of Natural History </a>(HMNH). Part of the HMNH’s Summer Nights at the Museum series, Montgomery described the experiences and adventures that led to her latest book, “Birdology: Adventures with a Pack of Hens, a Peck of Pigeons, Cantankerous Crows, Fierce Falcons, Hip Hop Parrots, Baby Hummingbirds, and One Murderously Big Living Dinosaur.”</p>
<p>In addition to her cassowary adventure, Montgomery described working at a California-based hummingbird rehabilitation center, raising two almost impossibly tiny hummingbird chicks that had been abandoned in their nest.</p>
<p>Montgomery, who is also author of the bestselling “The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood,” shared her unusual perspective and passion for the natural world with the audience. She described birds, and most particularly hummingbirds, as “made of air,” with hollow bones, internal air sacs, and feathers that outweigh their bones.</p>
<p>She helped to feed the baby birds with tiny syringes and watched them grow. Despite the demands of feedings every 20 minutes, she said she felt privileged to watch them begin to thrive, saying she fell “crazy in love with them.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing like a baby hummingbird to bring us back to what really matters in the world,” Montgomery said.</p>
<p>Montgomery said birds were her first animal love, fostered by a pet parakeet she had as a child, but that the subjects of her earlier books — mammals — kept getting in the way of her writing a book about them.</p>
<p>She pointed out that birds are the most common wild animals that most people see and are on the decline because of pollution, overpopulation, and climate change. Birds, like the endangered Kakapo that walked up to her during one forest visit, can be surprisingly trusting. It’s time for people to earn that trust, she said.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Craig R. McCoy, an investigative reporter at the Philadelphia Inquirer, has won the 2010 I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence.  ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation.aspx">Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard</a> will present the 2010 <a href="http://www.ifstone.org/medal.php">I.F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence</a> to <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20100612_Inquirer_s_Craig_McCoy_wins_I_F__Stone_Medal.html">Craig R. McCoy</a>, an investigative reporter at the <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.</p>
<p>For almost three decades, McCoy has exposed injustice and corruption in Philadelphia through his probing and meticulous investigative work. McCoy most recently headed a team that uncovered entrenched problems in Philadelphia’s criminal justice system, including abysmal conviction rates, rampant witness fear, and a massive number of fugitives.</p>
<p>Using statistical analysis, the paper’s investigation and resulting series, “<a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/78794487.html">Justice: Delayed, Dismissed, Denied</a>,”<em> </em>showed that defendants charged with violent crimes were escaping conviction in nearly two-thirds of cases. The reporting has triggered major reforms, including new state Supreme Court judicial rules, two investigations, federal and state hearings, and new legislation. McCoy joined staff writers Nancy Phillips, Dylan Purcell, John Sullivan, and Emilie Lounsberry in this project. In previous years, McCoy was part of larger teams that twice were finalists for the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/">Pulitzer Prize</a>.</p>
<p>Established in 2008, the Stone Medal rewards journalistic independence and honors the life of investigative journalist I.F. Stone. The award is administered by the Nieman Foundation and its <a href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/">Nieman Watchdog Project</a> and is presented annually to a journalist whose work captures the spirit of independence, integrity, and courage that characterized I.F. Stone’s Weekly, published 1953-1971.</p>
<p>McCoy will receive the award during a ceremony at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/com/">Boston University’s College of Communication</a> on Oct. 5. To read the full <a href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Showcase.view&amp;showcaseid=00131">announcement</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six Harvard University graduate students are among the 13 local graduate students who will spend the summer working in key state agencies as <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/rappaport/">Rappaport Public Policy Fellows</a>.</p>
<p>Now in its 10th year, the fellowship is a unique program that gives talented young graduate students throughout greater Boston the opportunity to help public officials address key problems and, in doing so, to learn more about how public policy is created and implemented.  The fellowship is funded and administered by <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School’s</a> (HKS) Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, which strives to improve the governance of the region by strengthening connections between scholars, students, officials, and civic leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Rappaport Public Policy Fellows</strong><br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL</strong><br />
<strong>Lalita Booth</strong>, who is in the joint Master in Public Policy (MPP)/Master in Business Administration (MBA) program at HKS and <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/">Harvard Business School</a>, will work at the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2agencylanding&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Government&amp;L2=Departments+and+Divisions&amp;L3=Department+of+Youth+Services&amp;sid=Eeohhs2">Massachusetts Department of Youth Services</a>.</p>
<p>First-year MPP students <strong>Jennifer Vorse</strong> and <strong>Michael Zakaras</strong> will work in the office of <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/mayor/">Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino</a> on the Circle of Promise Initiative, which seeks to break the cycle of poverty by linking ambitious efforts to turn around troubled schools in the city’s disadvantaged neighborhoods with other programs, assets, and resources in those neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL</strong><br />
<strong>Michael Honigberg</strong>, who recently completed his first year at <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), will work for the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy in the Performance Measurement Group. His primary task will be to produce a descriptive report on healthcare systems integration.</p>
<p><strong>Ravi Parikh</strong>, who also finished his first year at HMS, will work for the Joint Committee on Health Care Policy and produce a report for the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/memmenuh.htm">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> on pending legislation regarding the scope of practice of non-physician allied health professionals. He will also work on a project to analyze the effect of Massachusetts’ shift to global provider payments on single- or small group- practice physicians.</p>
<p><strong>GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS &amp; SCIENCES</strong><br />
<strong>Jeremy Levine</strong>, a second-year doctoral student in <a href="http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/">sociology</a>, also will work for Mayor Menino on the Circle of Promise Initiative. Levine has analyzed local community development policies in Detroit, the impact of unequal access to public transportation, and transportation policy as a means of combating urban poverty.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In an increasingly globalized world, soccer both benefits and suffers from a player’s ability to leave his homeland and compete on an international stage.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just call it globalization in cleats.</p>
<p>It’s the national pastime for most of the world, and increasingly soccer is becoming a sport without borders. In recent days, Cambridge taverns have been jammed with fans watching their favorite teams on television.</p>
<p>For the first time, the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/">FIFA World Cup</a> is being held in an African country, as South Africa plays host to the month-long tournament that runs through July 11. The event, which began in 1930 with 13 nations, today includes 32 teams vying for the title of best in the world in a competition long on heartbreak and heart-pounding play.</p>
<p>Over the years, the World Cup’s pool of competitors has expanded to include many African teams that were once considered long shots to claim the championship. While European and South American nations have largely dominated the competition in the past, several African contenders have steadily risen through the ranks. Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions, the Elephants from Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria’s Super Eagles, and Ghana’s Black Stars regularly qualify and threaten traditional powerhouses such as Brazil and Germany with their competitive, aggressive styles.</p>
<p>What’s behind this rise in play of African teams? According to a Harvard scholar, one answer is globalization.</p>
<p>Many of the world’s top club teams in England, Italy, and Germany recruit heavily from foreign countries now, drawing the best talent away from their domestic clubs with the promise of astronomical salaries and the opportunity to play against the world’s best.</p>
<p>Yet such moves can carry an underlying boon for a player’s national team, since his experience at the game’s highest levels can benefit his own country when he reports for duty on the national team. It’s this experience abroad, said <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/drodrik/">Dani Rodrik</a>, Rafiq Hariri Professor of International Political Economy at <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School, </a>that strengthens both a player’s own game and that of his national team.</p>
<p>“Some of these teams, like Côte d’Ivoire, have essentially all of their starting 11 playing on European teams, and many of them are actually stars in European leagues,” said Rodrik. “And I think the kind of experience and training that these players get has clearly strengthened the standing of their national teams.”</p>
<p>Of course, such globalization can also carry negative consequences. By depleting African nations of top talent, the competitiveness of domestic leagues tends to suffer. As with labor markets in poor countries that struggle with “brain drain” when top performers seek jobs elsewhere, so too do the soccer teams  that lose leading players to foreign clubs.</p>
<p>“Those who happen to be either talented or luckier tend to reap huge amounts of gain,” said Rodrik of what he called the “common story” of globalization. “In soccer …  my guess is that the domestic league competition in many of these countries has suffered, as the best talent is obviously abroad.”</p>
<p>But globalization of the world’s “beautiful game” can have other positive implications. North Korea, he said, which gave soccer behemoth Brazil a surprisingly tough time in a first-round match, could benefit from participating.</p>
<p>“It shows that even countries that … have insulated themselves so much … are just finding ways of coming back and influencing these economies,” said Rodrik. If North Korea performs “very well, it may reduce some of the mental impediments in engaging the world in a more open way.”</p>
<p>Rodrik admits that World Cup tournaments rarely “really pay for themselves,” because of the massive spending required for new stadiums and transportation infrastructure. But the games still can help to propel a country onto the world stage, providing prime opportunities for advertising and marketing, and leaving behind lasting improvements.</p>
<p>“It’s the train service, it’s the bus service, it’s the investment in housing … and all the public infrastructure,” said Rodrik. “I think South Africa could use that investment across the country.”</p>
<p>Though he hails from Turkey, Rodrik follows the English Premier League and roots for England. But if Turkey had qualified, rest assured, he would have been blowing his vuvuzela for the Turkish team.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The gigantic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from the catastrophe on BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig will change the way corporate officials think about future risks, Harvard officials say.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bp.com">BP</a>’s ruined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon">Deepwater Horizon</a> oil well is gushing questions as well as oil.</p>
<p>Harvard faculty members in fields related to the ongoing Gulf of Mexico spill say that even though it has been nearly two months since the destruction of BP’s drilling platform, oil is flowing from the ruptured well more quickly than answers are to the many questions raised by the disaster.</p>
<p>“They have to stop the oil,” said Ben Heineman, senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy School</a>’s (HKS) <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/">Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</a>. “And there are other large crisis management issues beyond that which must be addressed before the deeper questions of what were the root causes and how can we prevent such a catastrophe in the future.”</p>
<p>Even the most basic question of how big the spill is remains uncertain. Estimates of flow rates have risen steadily. Also unknown is where that oil is, since dispersants have kept much of it below the Gulf’s surface. The environmental impact of those hidden layers of oil — and of the dispersants themselves — are unknown. Other questions, which await the inevitable investigations, involve the future of deep-water drilling and regulation of similarly risky industrial activity.</p>
<p>“In the short run, this may be one of the worst environmental disasters we have seen, but what the public doesn’t know is the extent of the environmental damage,” said <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/experts/144/henry_lee.html">Henry Lee</a>, director of the <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/project/43/environment_and_natural_resources.html">Environmental and Natural Resource Program</a> at HKS.</p>
<p>Harvard officials are adding their voices to the Gulf crisis. Florida officials have looked to <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/james-shine/">James Shine</a>, senior lecturer on aquatic chemistry at the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/">Harvard School of Public Health</a>, for advice on consuming fish, and President Barack Obama on Monday (June 14) named <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/camurray">Dean Cherry Murray</a> of Harvard’s <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> to a panel investigating the disaster and its implications for future drilling.</p>
<p>HKS researchers, meanwhile, are probing the implications for the oil industry’s future — and that of other industries at risk of rare but potentially cataclysmic disasters, including nuclear power, chemical manufacturing, and airlines.</p>
<p>To Shine, whose aquatic biogeochemistry research group studies the transport, fate, and effects of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, a key question concerns the dispersants, the chemicals spread on the oil to break up slicks into smaller droplets.</p>
<p>Dispersants have been tried in the past without demonstrably helpful results, Shine said. Though it may seem that dispersing the oil into smaller concentrations is a good thing, there are problems with that strategy. First, he said, researchers know how oil slicks behave. They float on the surface where some oil evaporates and the rest is affected by wind and waves in predictable ways. Dispersants, however, keep the slicks underwater, possibly layered at various depths, and eventually deposit them on the seabed.</p>
<p>Also unknown, Shine said, is the effect of the dispersants on marine life. While much attention has been paid to the potential effects of the oil on birds, fish, and other marine life, dispersants also can affect biological oils, such as those coating fish gills.</p>
<p>In many cases, Shine said, the use of dispersants boils down to a question of which ecosystem we want to pollute most. Floating oil that reaches shore can affect marshes, which provide important ecosystem services, such as flood control, and act as nurseries for many marine species. But dispersed oil that remains at sea can contaminate seafood and damage fishermen’s livelihoods.</p>
<p>“Do you want contaminated wetlands, or do you want contaminated fish?” Shine asked.</p>
<p>Some of the oil will be cleaned up on the beaches, and some will break down biologically, but much of it will wind up in sediments, where it can continue to harm ecosystems. Oil from a spill in Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts in the 1970s is still measurable in nearby marshes, Shine said.</p>
<p>The longer the well continues to gush oil into the Gulf, however, the more variability there will be in the answers to these questions, Shine said. As the seasons change, weather patterns shift as well, and hurricanes become more likely, affecting the spill in unforeseen ways.</p>
<p>Lee said that even authorities who might be expected to know more about the spill and its behavior before the public does, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Lubchenco">Jane Lubchenco</a>, administrator of the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, admit that tremendous uncertainty remains about the spill’s effects. Even the facts that researchers think they know may not prove so accurate, Lee said.</p>
<p>The size and scope of the disaster throws not just the future of offshore drilling into doubt but also the regulatory bodies that had overseen it. Lee believes that the disaster makes it less likely that drilling will be allowed in other key areas, such as off the Atlantic coast, off southern California, and perhaps off Alaska.</p>
<p>Still, offshore drilling as an energy strategy is likely to continue, Lee said, because new oil discoveries continue to be made under the oceans, and the nation’s economy needs the fuel. Still, he applauded the Obama administration’s moratorium on new deep-sea drilling, which should allow time for some of these issues to be worked out.</p>
<p>In the months ahead, Lee predicted that technological problems, systems shortcomings, and human error will be shown to have contributed to the Gulf disaster. But he also predicted that the industry will develop a newfound fervor to monitor safety in other locations.</p>
<p>The industry’s biggest problem, Lee said, will be the government response. With public pressure to mitigate damage, recoup losses, punish those responsible, and safeguard the future, it is possible that get-tough regulatory measures could make it harder for oil companies to do business. BP is an obvious target for governmental ire, Lee said, but the company is large enough to handle even billions of dollars in fines, repayments, and other costs.</p>
<p>The eventual effects of the spill will likely be felt beyond the oil industry, said Heineman. Industries that could experience similar catastrophes — low probability but high consequence, such as chemical manufacturers, nuclear power plant operators, and even emerging industries where risks aren’t clearly defined, such as nanotechnology — may feel the effects of BP’s woes, Heineman said.</p>
<p>Leaders in such industries may have to calculate how much to spend to ensure that a cataclysmic event doesn’t happen, which is a difficult calculus for profit-making companies, since it requires large sums to prevent an event that might never occur.</p>
<p>In the past, Heineman said, industry leaders might have had to plan for a one-in-a-million chance of a catastrophe. In the future, they need to plan for one-in-a-billion or one-in-a-trillion mishap, rendering risk as close as possible to highly remote in fact, not just in theory.</p>
<p>New technology to improve the safety of deepwater drilling will also be needed, Heineman said, and perhaps required by regulators. “We have to have new technology and innovation, but what degree of safety are we going to require? We’re in a world where our technological capacity may be outstripping our ability to manage technology,” Heineman said.</p>
<p>Heineman said there was a failure of leadership on several fronts in the Gulf disaster. BP’s managers damaged the company’s reputation by failing to secure the well, and by their repeated inaccurate assessments of the amount of oil flowing from it. That issue, he said, has also hurt the federal government’s credibility. Instead of going along with BP’s flow estimates, he said, the Obama administration should have a leader of national stature in overall control of the response and should have assembled much more quickly teams from the public sector, the private sector, and academia to continuously develop facts, articulating for the public what we know, what we don’t know, and how we can close the gap.</p>
<p>“The government has failed to convene the right kind of scientific experts who can be transparent about what we know and what we don’t know,” Heineman said. “In a national disaster like this one, the government is responsible for the facts, and for demarcating which private sector and which public sector authorities are responsible both for developing response action options and then for implementing them. The government gets low marks for such a coherent and comprehensive effort to date.”</p>
