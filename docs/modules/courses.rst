The Courses module provides an interface to the university-wide course catalog for Harvard University. It provides the following high-level functionality:

    * Browse classes by School and Departments/Programs
    * View individual class details
    * Search for classes (in all schools; specific schools; specific department/programs)

Schools and Department/Programs

The list of schools and departments/programs within each school is requested by the iPhone app as soon as the application is launched (and if the schools are not cached on the iPhone itself):
